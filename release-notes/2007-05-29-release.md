## UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot major release (53.0)

Release 53.0 of 29-May-07 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains 269'293 sequence entries, comprising 98'902758 amino acids abstracted from 156'204 references. 9'228 sequences have been added since release 52.0: this represents a 3.5% increase. In addition, the sequence data of 734 existing entries have been updated and the annotations of 210'454 entries have been revised.

The following improvements were carried out in the last 3 months:

- We have created a new comment subsection: SEQUENCE CAUTION. This subsection is used for all the comments related to submitted sequences which differ from the sequence shown in the entry because of conflicts, such as frameshifts, erroneous gene model predictions, erroneous translation or other discrepancies that cannot be described in the feature 'Conflict'.
- We have added cross-references to 3 new databases: [BuruList](http://genolist.pasteur.fr/BuruList/), a database dedicated to the analysis of Mycobacterium ulcerans genome, [Orphanet](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/home.php?Lng=GB), a database dedicated to information on rare diseases and orphan drugs, and [PseudoCAP](http://www.pseudomonas.com/), a Pseudomonas genome database.

UniProt Knowledgebase release 11.0 includes Swiss-Prot release 53.0 and TrEMBL release 36.0.

We are pleased to announce a new UniProt database, the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequences (UniMES) database, a repository specifically developed for metagenomic and environmental data. UniMES is available in FASTA format on the UniProt ftp servers, in the new subdirectory **current_release/unimes** :

- [ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot)
- [ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot)
- [ftp.expasy.org/databases/uniprot](ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/uniprot)

# UniProtKB News

## New ftp directory for UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequences (UniMES)

We have added a new subdirectory, **current_release/unimes**, to the UniProt ftp servers

- [ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot)
- [ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot)
- [ftp.expasy.org/databases/uniprot](ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/uniprot)

to distribute metagenomic and environmental sequences.

## New comment subsection SEQUENCE CAUTION

We have introduced a new subsection in the General Annotation (Comments) section, SEQUENCE CAUTION, to describe protein sequence reports that differ from the sequence that is shown in UniProtKB due to conflicts that are not described in the SEQUENCE CONFLICT lines (Features), such as frameshifts, erroneous gene model predictions, etc. This kind of information was before reported in the topic CAUTION together with other warnings that are unrelated to sequence conflicts.

The format of the SEQUENCE CAUTION topic is:

         CC   -!- SEQUENCE CAUTION:
         Sequence=Sequence; Type=Type;[ Positions=Positions;][ Note=Note;]

Where:

- _Sequence_ is the sequence which differs from the UniProtKB sequence. It is described by one of:
  - an EMBL protein identifier (with version number)
  - an EMBL accession number.
  - a literature reference (e.g. Ref. 3).
- _Type_ describes the cause for the sequence difference(s) and is one of:
  - Frameshift
  - Erroneous initiation
  - Erroneous termination
  - Erroneous gene model prediction
  - Erroneous translation
  - Miscellaneous discrepancy
- _Positions_ describes the UniProtKB sequence position(s) or range(s) of the difference(s) where possible. Sometimes the term 'Several' is used to indicate that there are many differences.
- _Note_ is an optional free text explanation.

These lines are not wrapped and their length may therefore exceed 75 characters.

Examples:

## Change in comment subsection SUBCELLULAR LOCATION

From now on, the comment subsection SUBCELLULAR LOCATION may occur more than once per entry.

## Cross-references to PseudoCAP

Cross-references have been added to the [Pseudomonas aeruginosa Community Annotation Project database](http://www.pseudomonas.com/). This database provides genome annotation of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 and of other Pseudomonas species, acting as a valuable comparative resource for P. aeruginosa research, as well as being useful for the larger Pseudomonas research community. Over the coming year this database will be further enhanced toward more focus on comparative analysis of P. aeruginosa isolates and more specific information about putative drug and vaccine targets.

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa Community Annotation Project database is available at <http://www.pseudomonas.com/>.

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>PseudoCAP</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Ordered locus name.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>Q9I576:
DR   PseudoCAP; PA0865; -.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Cross-references to Orphanet

Cross-references have been added to the [Orphanet database](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/home.php?Lng=GB). This database is dedicated to information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. It aims to improve management and treatment of genetic, auto-immune or infectious rare diseases, rare cancers, or not yet classified rare diseases. ORPHANET offers services adapted to the needs of patients and their families, health professionals and researchers, support groups and industry.

The Orphanet database is available at <http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/home.php?Lng=GB>.

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 37%" /><col style="width: 62%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>Orphanet</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Orphanet unique disease identifier.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>Name of the disease.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>P26439:
DR   Orphanet; 418; Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital.
DR   Orphanet; 3185; Stein-Leventhal syndrome.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
