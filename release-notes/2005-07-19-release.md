## Orangutan, the most represented non-human primate in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

With more than 500 entries, [**Pongo pygmaeus (Orangutan)**](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9600) is now the most represented non-human primate. Most of these entries are built around sequence data generated by a cDNA sequencing project launched by the [German cDNA Consortium](http://mips.gsf.de/proj/cdna/Sites/PP_cDNA_Project.htm) in 2003. Almost 4'000 entries submitted by the consortium are still in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. It should be noted however that some of these sequences are fragments and are thus not a priority for UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotation. We plan to manually annotate as many Orangutan entries as possible, starting with sequences orthologous to human ones already described in Swiss-Prot.

There are currently almost 15'500 primate entries in Swiss-Prot, 82% of which describe human proteins.

  

# UniProtKB News

## Obsolete file uniprot\_trembl\_varsplic.fasta.gz

All UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries with annotated alternative splicing events (KW Alternative splicing) have been moved to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Thus the file uniprot\_trembl\_varsplic.fasta.gz became obsolete and has been removed from the ftp site.

Please note that UniProtKB/TrEMBL still includes splice isoforms, but each in an individual entry and not merged into one single entry.

## Cross-references to Genew

The format of the UniProtKB cross-reference to the Human Gene Nomenclature Database [Genew](http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl) has changed: The term Genew has been replaced by HGNC, which stands for HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee.

Example:

    DR Genew; HGNC:12849; YWHAB.

has changed to

    DR HGNC; HGNC:12849; YWHAB.
