## Engaging and disengaging: CRISPR rings

[CRISPR-Cas systems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30193985) are an RNA-guided adaptive immune response that bacteria and archaea use to defend against invasive genetic elements of bacterial (plasmid) or viral origin. Pieces of foreign DNA incorporated into CRISPR arrays provide a "memory" of having encountered the invader. These arrays are transcribed and processed, and the resulting CRISPR RNA (crRNA) is used by the interference complex to recognize the invader if it is re-encountered. Once recognized, foreign nucleic acids are quickly degraded, providing immunity. There are different types of CRISPR-Cas systems, mainly characterized by the presence or absence of certain Cas proteins. For example, the Cas3, Cas9, and Cas10 proteins are hallmarks of the CRISPR/Cas types I, II and III, respectively. The best known system is the type II Cas9-encoding system, which has been coopted by scientists for genome editing. The most intriguing one is the type III system, which has additional, novel control mechanisms not found in the other systems.

The type III interference complex is composed of crRNA, Cas10 and proteins Csm2, Csm3, Csm4 and Csm5. Once the target RNA has bound to the Csm interference complex it is cleaved by the complex, which acts as a sequence-specific endoribonuclease (RNase). There is an additional component to this system: Csm6. Under basal conditions, Csm6 is an inactive RNase and is not part of the Csm complex, however its presence is required for full CRISPR-Cas immunity where it non-specifically degrades invader-derived RNA transcripts. How then is Csm6 RNase activity turned on and, once activated, how is it turned off, considering that an uncontrolled RNase activity could be detrimental to the cell? The answer to these questions has been revealed in recent publications. Homodimeric Csm6 is activated by cyclic oligoadenylates (cOA), ring-shaped second messengers synthesized by the C-terminal GGDEF (also called Palm) domain of Cas10. Binding of cOA to the Csm6 dimer interface pocket formed by its CARF (CRISPR-associated Rossman fold) domains allosterically regulates its RNase activity. The type of cyclic oligoadenylates produced is species-specific. [_Streptococcus thermophilus_ and _Enterococcus italicus_ make cyclic hexaadenylate (cA <sub>6</sub>)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28663439,28722012), while Csm6 of _Thermus thermophilus_ is [stimulated by cyclic tetraadenylate (cA <sub>4</sub>)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28663439,28722012), suggesting Cas10 in this organism synthesizes cA <sub>4</sub>. As the target RNA associated with the CRISPR complex is degraded, the cOA synthase activity of Cas10 shuts off, halting second messenger synthesis. Additionally, 2 proteins with ring-specific nuclease activity able to degrade cOA have been recently isolated from _Saccharolobus solfataricus_ (formerly called _Sulfolobus solfataricus_), which would turn down Csm6 activity and [prevent uncontrolled degradation of cellular RNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30232454).

As of this release several [Cas10 proteins](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=accession:E6LHV7+OR+accession:A0A0A7HFE1+OR+accession:Q53W19) and the [ring nucleases](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=accession:Q7LYJ6+OR+accession:Q97YD2) of _S.solfataricus_ have been annotated and can be retrieved.
