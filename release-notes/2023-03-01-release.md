## Killing me softly

In order to rapidly get rid of infectious microorganisms our innate immune system relies, among others, on specific intracellular receptors which recognize patterns that are frequently found in pathogens. One of these pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), NLRC4, recognizes many different bacterial pathogens, including _Salmonella typhimurium_, by sensing bacterial flagellin or structural components of the bacterial type III secretion system that are injected or leaked into the host cell. NLRC4 activation leads to the assembly of inflammasomes, large cytosolic multiprotein complexes, which results in the activation of caspase 1 (CASP1). CASP1 initiates inflammatory responses, including [activation of the cytokines IL1B and IL18](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27153493/), and cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD). This latter forms pores in the plasma membrane, leading to inflammatory cell death, called pyroptosis, within minutes to hours. At the end of this cascade, the cell is dead. End of story? Well, not really. The activation of inflammasomes does not always lead to pyroptosis, and [in certain settings, cells with active inflammasomes and gasdermin pores demonstrate a hypersecretory cytokine phenotype without undergoing cell death.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35947978/) How is this possible?

Yet another aspect of the process was unclear. CASP1 also activates 'apoptotic' caspases, such as CASP3 and CASP7, with CASP3 being the primary apoptotic executioner and CASP7 being considered as an inefficient CASP3 back-up. However, CASP7 pro-apoptotic activity is very weak, if it has any. What then is CASP7's function?

Our understanding of the process made a leap forward thanks to a recent article by [Nozaki et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705808/) Using intestinal epithelial cell organoid cultures and transgenic mice, the authors studied _S.typhimurium_ infection. As expected in this setting, NLRC4 activation resulted in CASP1 activation. CASP1 in turn activated GSDMD and CASP7. As expected, GSDMD formed pores at the plasma membrane. The new observation is that CASP7 activated a lysosomal enzyme, [sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=gene:SMPD1+AND+taxonomy_name:vertebrata+AND+reviewed:true), also called ASM or SMPD1, which converts sphingomyelin into ceramide. Sphingomyelin is a major constituent of the plasma membrane in animal cells, allowing the membrane to remain largely flat. The formation of ceramide at the cell surface causes the membrane to naturally invaginate, inducing spontaneous clathrin-independent endocytosis that internalizes GSDMD pores, ensuring local repair of the plasma membrane. But how can cytosolic CASP7 activate a lysosomal protein? The current hypothesis is that GSDMD pores allow a massive influx of calcium, which causes lysosomal exocytosis and delivers pro-SMPD1 to the cell surface. CASP7 could pass from the cytosol through the pores to the extracellular space, where the proteins would meet at the best location for rapid membrane repair.

In the intestinal epithelium, the removal of dying cells proceeds through a [unique process called cell extrusion, in order to preserve the integrity of barrier function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27212253/). During extrusion, the cell fated to die emits the lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate, which causes contraction of an actomyosin ring in the neighboring cells. This contraction acts to squeeze the cell out apically while drawing together neighboring cells and preventing any gaps in the epithelial barrier. In this context, SMPD1-mediated repair of the plasma membrane would delay the rapid pore-driven cell lysis to allow the slower extrusion process to engage.

Interestingly, these findings can be expanded to other cell types and infections. For instance, SMPD1 also mediates the repair of pores made by natural killer cell perforin in hepatocytes infected by _Chromobacterium violaceum_.

# UniParc news

## Change of the UniParc files distribution

The UniParc database is distributed on the [UniProt FTP site](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/uniparc/) in FASTA and XML format as one gzip-compressed file for each format. The size of these files has grown over the years to now more that 100 and 200 Gigabytes, respectively, which makes them difficult to download. We now therefore split these files into sets of 128 smaller files each. The partitioned files are available in the following subdirectories:

|                                                                                    |                                      |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/uniparc/xml/all      | all sequences in XML format          |
| https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/uniparc/fasta/active | all active sequences in FASTA format |

For release 2023_01, we are providing each format as one file and partitioned into 128 smaller files. From release 2023_02 onwards, only the partitioned files will be provided.
