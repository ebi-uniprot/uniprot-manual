                             1. INTRODUCTION

       1.1  Evolution

       Release 12.0  of SWISS-PROT  contains 12305 sequence entries, comprising
       3'797'482 amino  acids abstracted from 12147 references. This represents
       an increase of 16% over release 11.0. The recent growth of the data bank
       is summarized below:

       1.2  Source of data

       Release 12.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data from release
       21.0 of  the PIR (Protein Identification Resource) protein data bank, as
       well as translation of nucleotide sequence data from release 20.0 of the
       EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library.

       As an  indication to  the source  of the sequence data in the SWISS-PROT
       data bank  we list  here the  statistics  concerning  the  DR  (Databank
       Reference) pointer lines:

       Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):           3125
       Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):          4873
       Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es):  3575
       Entries with no pointers lines (entered in house):        732



          2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE RELEASE 11

       2.1  Sequences and annotations

       Some 1466  new sequences  have been  added since  the last  release, the
       sequence  data  of  173  existing  entries  has  been  updated  and  the
       annotations of  2400 entries  have been  revised. In  particular we have
       used reviews  articles to update the annotations of the following groups
       or families of proteins:

          Acyl carrier proteins
          Aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases
          Biotin-requiring enzymes
          Chloroplast photosystems I and II proteins
          Creatine kinases
          Crp bacterial activator proteins
          Enolases
          Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases
          Glutaredoxins
          GTP-binding elongation factors
          Heat shock hsp90 proteins
          Insulin family proteins
          Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
          Insect-type alcohol dehydrogenases / ribitol dehydrogenase family
          Integrins
          Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases
          LysR bacterial activator proteins
          Malate dehydrogenase
          Mammalian defensins
          Mitochondrial energy transfer proteins
          Myc-type proteins
          Phosphoglucose isomerases
          Phosphoglycerate kinases
          Serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases
          Sugar transporters
          Uracil-DNA glycosylases
          Vertebrate galactoside-binding lectins
          Zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases


       2.2  New line-type

       This release  introduce an  new type  of data  line, the OG line. The OG
       (OrGanelle) lines  indicate if  the gene coding for a protein originates
       from the mitochondria, the chloroplast, or a plasmid. The format for the
       OG line is:

       OG   CHLOROPLAST.
       OG   MITOCHONDRION.
       OG   PLASMID name.

       Where 'name' is the name of the plasmid.

       Previously this  information was  stored in the OS line, as shown in the
       example below.

       OS   WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM) CHLOROPLAST.

       The above example will now be stored as:

       OS   WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM).
       OG   CHLOROPLAST.


       2.3  New topic for the comments (CC) line type

       As of release 12 we have added a new 'topic' for the comments (CC) line-
       type: CAUTION,  which is  used to  warn  about  possible  errors  and/or
       grounds for confusion. Example of its usage:

         CC   -!- CAUTION: ALSO SEE VERSION 2 OF THIS PROTEIN THAT DIFFERS DUE
         CC       TO A FRAMESHIFT.


       2.4  Documentation changes

       -  ACINDEX.TXT is  a new  document file  which is  an index  of all  the
          accession numbers  which appear  in SWISS-PROT  and the  name of  the
          entries in which they occur.
       -  PDBTOSP.TXT is  a new  document file  which is  an index  of all  the
          Brookhaven PDB entries referenced in SWISS-PROT.
       -  The JOURLIST.TXT document now indicates the abbreviation and the full
          names of all journals cited in SWISS-PROT.


                                 3. THE NEXT RELEASE

       SWISS-PROT release 13.0 will be available in January 1990.

       Starting with  release 13 SWISS-PROT will be distributed with PROSITE, a
       data bank  of sites  and patterns  in proteins.  Both data banks will be
       fully cross-referenced.



                                4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

       We welcome  any feedback  from our users. We especially would appreciate
       that you notify us if you find that sequences belonging to your field of
       expertise are  missing from  the data  bank. We  also would  like to  be
       notified about annotations to be updated, as for example if the function
       of a protein has been clarified or if new post-translational information
       has become available.

       B.2  IBM PS/2 1.4 Mb disks

       The number  and content  of the  1.4 Mb  disks for  the PS/2 systems are
       exactly identical to those of the 1.2 Mb disks (see above).
