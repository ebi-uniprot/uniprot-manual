## Fungi and Swiss-Prot

As we are reaching the 10'000 entries mark for fungi in Swiss-Prot, we believe it is useful to inform our users that we are actively working in speeding up the annotation and re-annotation of fungal protein sequences and most notably those originating from the two model organisms [_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/4932) and [_Schizosaccharomyces pombe_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/4896). We are currently building up a fungal annotation group which will soon consist of four annotators, three in Geneva and one in Hinxton.

# UniProt news

## Changes concerning keywords

New keywords:

- [Direct protein sequencing](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0903)
- [Nuclear pore complex](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0906)

## Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). For the feature key [MOD_RES](https://www.uniprot.org/manual/mod_res), the new initially introduced controlled vocabularies for PTMs are:

- Bromination: All entries with annotated bromination sites have the keyword [Bromination](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0102).

       Bromohistidine
       6'-bromotryptophan

- Deamidation

       Deamidated asparagine
       Deamidated glutamine

- Formylation: All entries with annotated formylation sites have the keyword [Formylation](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0291).

       N-formylmethionine
       N-formylglycine

- Hydroxylation: All entries with annotated hydroxylation sites have the keyword [Hydroxylation](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0379).

       Hydroxyproline
       3-hydroxyasparagine
       3-hydroxyaspartate
       5-hydroxylysine
       3-hydroxytryptophan

- Iodination: All entries with annotated iodination sites have the keyword [Iodination](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0405).

       Thyroxine
       Triiodothyronine

- Other new controlled vocabularies for PTMs that are annotated with the feature key MOD_RES:

       3',4'-dihydroxyphenylalanine
       3-methylthioaspartic acid
       3-oxoalanine (Cys)
       3-oxoalanine (Ser)
       4-carboxyglutamate (Keyword: Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid)
       ADP-ribosylarginine
       ADP-ribosylcysteine
       Allysine
       Aspartyl isopeptide (Asn)
       Cysteine persulfide
       Pentaglycyl murein peptidoglycan amidated threonine
       PolyADP-ribosyl glutamic acid
       Pyruvic acid (Ser)
       Pyruvic acid (Cys)
       S-nitrosocysteine (Keyword: S-nitrosylation)

- Unidentified modifications

       Alanine derivative
       Arginine derivative
       Cysteine derivative
