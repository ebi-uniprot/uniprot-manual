### ZTGC: bacteriophages reinvent the DNA alphabet

In 1977, [Kirnos et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/413053) isolated a DNA virus acting on blue-green algae, called cyanophage S-2L, from water samples taken in the outskirts of Leningrad (known today as [Saint Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint%5FPetersburg) ). They reported a weird DNA composition for this virus. Instead of the usual adenine (6-aminopurine or A), the bacteriophage contained [2,6-diaminopurine](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:40235) (DAP), also known as 2-aminoadenine, abbreviated Z in recent publications. The presence of the additional amino group in adenine [changes several DNA features](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30795872/). The most striking difference is that DAP forms 3 hydrogen bonds when paired with thymine, instead of the usual 2 bonds between adenine and thymine, hence forming a stronger, more stable pair. The presence of DAP confers selective advantages to bacteriophages, such as [resistance to most restriction enzymes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2820801,2829119,33926954/). Consequently, these viruses can evade the host bacterial defense system based on foreign DNA degradation.

In view of the complete substitution of adenine by DAP, [Kirnos et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/413053) proposed that DAP was incorporated into S-2L phage DNA as a ready-made nucleotide, rather than formed at the polynucleotide level as a result of amination of adenine residues within DNA. However, it took almost half a century to [unravel the pathway of DAP synthesis and its incorporation into DNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926954,33926955,33926956,33893297). This pathway intermingles viral and bacterial enzymes in tight collaboration. The first step of DAP synthesis involves the condensation of aspartate with deoxyguanylate to form N6-succino-2-amino-2'-deoxyadenylate ( [dSMP](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:172924) ). The reaction is catalyzed by phage PurZ. dSMP is then converted into 2-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine monophosphate ( [dZMP](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:172927) ) by an enzyme encoded by *purB*. dZMP is further phosphorylated by guanylate kinase ( *gmk* ) and by nucleoside diphosphate kinase ( *ndk* ) to produce 2-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate ( [dZTP](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:172931) ). All three enzymes, encoded by the *purB*, *gmk* and *ndk* genes, are provided by the bacterial host. dZTP is incorporated into phage DNA by viral DpoZ polymerase, which shares similarity with the Klenow fragment of *Escherichia coli* DNA polymerase I. The selective incorporation of dZTP rather than dATP into phage DNA is still a matter of debate. [Pezo et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33926956/) showed that DpoZ has a strong preference for dZTP over dATP. However, [Czernecki and Zhou](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33893297,33926954) proposed another mechanism of dATP exclusion, in which another phage enzyme, a dATPase called DatZ, would break up dATP, while preserving dZTP. The removal of dATP (and of its precursor dADP) from the nucleotide pool of the host would prevent the incorporation of adenine into the phage genome.

If cyanophage S-2L looked like a strange outlier 50 years ago, nowadays its amazing DNA composition appears to be more widespread than anticipated. PurZ has been identified in over a hundred bacteriophages, that infect a variety of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and actinobacteria, and the presence of Z-genomes have been experimentally proven in several of them. DAP usage to convey genetic information may be ancient. Phylogenic trees of PurZ and DpoZ indicate that DAP may have been used among siphoviruses since the [evolutionary divergence of actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, and proteobacteria some 3.5 billion years ago](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33926956/). Moreover DAP, along with other nucleobases, [has been found in meteorites](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21836052/), suggesting it could have been available before the advent of life for constructing the first genetic molecules.

As of this release, representative entries for the proteins involved in viral Z-genome manufacturing have been manually annotated and are publicly available. These entries include viral [PurZ](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:G3FFN6+or+accession:A0A7U3TBV6+or+accession:A0A2L0V130+or+accession:A0A2H5BHJ6), DNA polymerase [DpoZ](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:A0A2H5BHJ5+or+accession:A0A2L0V166+or+accession:G3FFN8) and dATPase [DatZ](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:A0A7U3TCA2+or+accession:A0A2H5BHG9+or+accession:A0A2L0V156+or+accession:G3FFN4) and bacterial [PurB](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:A0A0H3AL67+or+accession:P0AB89), [Gmk](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q3AWM1+or+accession:Q7U570+or+accession:Q9KNM4+or+accession:Q5N570+or+accession:Q0I868+or+accession:Q3ALX6+or+accession:Q2JQ59+or+accession:Q8KPQ7+or+accession:Q57I92+or+accession:Q2JQB9) and [Ndk](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q57LI3+or+accession:A5F3F7+or+accession:Q3AGP0+or+accession:B2I3E1+or+accession:B0V4U1+or+accession:B1XIE7+or+accession:Q5N1M1+or+accession:B7H073+or+accession:Q9KTX4+or+accession:C0PYM7+or+accession:Q7U3S1+or+accession:B0VKS3+or+accession:Q3AVV5+or+accession:Q2JVI1+or+accession:B7I5G3+or+accession:C3LT09+or+accession:P50590+or+accession:Q0I6J3+or+accession:A5GPE9+or+accession:A3M207+or+accession:Q2JPL4). Viral PurZ proteins can also be identified with [a newly created HAMAP family profile](https://hamap.expasy.org/signature/MF%5F04166) .

It should be noted that DAP has been first abbreviated 'D', but more recently the abbreviation 'Z' took over and DNA containing this nucleotide was called 'Z-DNA'. This latter nomenclature may be [misleading](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34131341/). The term 'Z-DNA' classically refers to a specific [left-handed double helical structure in which the helix winds to the left in a zigzag pattern, instead of to the right, like the more common B-DNA form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-DNA). This type of structure does not contain 2,6-diaminopurine.
