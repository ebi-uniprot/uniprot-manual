## The ComX pheromone

ComX, a pheromone involved in a major quorum sensing system in bacilli, is post-translationally modified by strain-specific prenylation.

In order to acquire genetic competence once the cell density has reached a critical threshold, bacteria have developed a sophisticated quorum-sensing system. This system proceeds through the release of a pheromone, [comX](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8VL79), that activates a two-component system, which eventually propagates the signal into the cell. Both components of this system have been identified: they are the sensor histidine kinase, [comP](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q99027), and the response regulator, the transcription factor [comA](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P14204).

The crucial pheromone ComX is produced as an inactive precursor which is activated by 2 post-translational modifications (PTM): the prenylation of a conserved tryptophan residue and a proteolytic cleavage. The protein [comQ](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P33690) is thought to catalyze the maturation of comX. ComX and comQ sequences show striking variability among different strains, as do the prenyl derivatives. The mass of the prenyl groups linked to comX has been determined by mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, three different masses were observed: 120Da, 136Da and 205Da, depending on the strain studied. The 136 and 205Da forms are thought to consist of farnesyl and geranyl groups, respectively. The [structure of the 205Da prenyl group](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16407988) in strain W23/RO-E-2 was recently obtained ([Q8VL79](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8VL79)). It consists of a geranyl group bound to a cyclic tryptophan. Interestingly enough, the nature of the prenyl group was shown to depend on the comX sequence itself rather than on the origin of the modifying enzyme comQ.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a post-translational prenylation catalyzed by a bacterial enzyme, despite the universal availability of the necessary isoprenoid substrates and the existence of various other lipid-modified proteins in this kingdom. The exact function of comX prenylation is not known, but, by analogy with the situation in eukaryotes, it may provide anchoring to membrane structures.

Of note, this PTM, like all other PTMs in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, is annotated using [controlled vocabulary](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist).

# UniProtKB News

## Changes in the tisslist.txt file

The [tisslist.txt](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/tisslist) file lists the tissues that are used in the "TISSUE" topic of the [references](https://www.uniprot.org/manual/references) of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. It has been changed in the following way:

Each term in the list has an accession number and optionally further relevant information such as synonyms and mappings to [eVOC](http://www.evocontology.org/) terms. eVOC contains four ontologies - Anatomical system, Cell type, Developmental stage, Pathology - which provide appropriate sets of detailed terms that describe the sample source of human experimental material such as cDNA and SAGE libraries.

The file contains the following line types:

    ---------  ---------------------------     ----------------------
    Line code  Content                         Occurrence in an entry
    ---------  ---------------------------     ----------------------
    ID         Identifier (tissue)             Once; starts an entry
    AC         Accession (TS-xxxx)             Once
    SY         Synonyms                        Optional; Once or more
    DR         eVOC ontologies (eVOC) mapping  Optional; Once or more
    //         Terminator                      Once; ends an entry
