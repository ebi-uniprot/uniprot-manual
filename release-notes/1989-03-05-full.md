       1.2  Source of data

       Release 10.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data
       from  release  19.0  of  the  PIR  (Protein  Identification
       Resource) protein  data bank,  as well  as  translation  of
       nucleotide sequence  data from  release 18.0  of  the  EMBL
       nucleotide sequence Data Library.

       As an  indication to the source of the sequence data in the
       SWISS-PROT data bank we list here the statistics concerning
       the DR (Databank Reference) pointer lines:

       Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):          3009
       Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):         3383
       Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es): 2973
       Entries with no pointers lines (entered in house):       643


       2. Description  of the  changes made  to  SWISS-PROT  since
          release 9

       2.1  Sequences and annotations

       Some 1306  new sequences  have been  added since  the  last
       release, the sequence data of 159 existing entries has been
       updated and  the annotations  of  1699  entries  have  been
       revised. In  particular we  have used  reviews articles  to
       update the  annotations of the following groups or families
       of proteins:

          Aerolysin type toxins
          Asparaginases / Glutaminases
          Aspartyl proteases
          ATP-binding proteins 'active transport' family
          Bacterial and fungi ribonucleases
          Bowman-Birk serine protease inhibitors
          Cadherins
          Calcitonins
          Clathrin light chains
          Crystallins beta and gamma
          Cytosine-specific DNA methylases
          Colony stimulating factors
          Glucagon / GIP / secretin / VIP family
          E1-E2 ATPases
          Crystaline entomocidal toxin proteins
          Fos/jun proteins family.
          Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase

          Interferons induced proteins
          Kazal serine protease inhibitors
          Lipoxygenases
          LysR bacterial activator proteins family
          Manganese and Iron superoxide dismutases
          Myb family proteins
          Myc family proteins
          Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
          Pancreatic hormone / Neuropeptide Y family
          Pancreatic ribonucleases
          Peptidyl-prolyl     cis-trans     isomerase     (ppiase)
          (cyclophilin)
          Platelet factor 4 family.
          Shiga/Ricin ribosomal inactivating toxins
          Somatotropin, prolactin and related hormones
          Squash family of serine protease inhibitors
          Thymidylate synthase
          TNF alpha and beta
          Topoisomerases type II
          Tropomyosins


       2.2  New format for the date (DT) line type

       The format of the DT line has been changed and is now:

        DT   DD-MMM-YYYY  (REL. XX, COMMENT)

       where DD  is the  day, MMM the month, YYYY the year, and XX
       the SWISS-PROT  release number.  The comment portion of the
       line indicates  the action  taken on  That date.  There are
       always three  DT lines  in each  entry,  each  of  them  is
       associated with a specific comment:

       -  The  first  DT  line  indicates  when  the  entry  first
          appeared in  the data  bank. The  associated comment  is
          "CREATED".
       -  The second  DT line indicates when the sequence data was
          last modified.  The associated comment is "LAST SEQUENCE
          UPDATE".
       -  The third DT line indicates when any data other then the
          sequence was  last modified.  The associated  comment is
          "LAST ANNOTATION UPDATE".

       Example of a block of DT lines:

       DT   01-JAN-1988  (REL. 06, CREATED)
       DT   01-AUG-1988  (REL. 08, LAST SEQUENCE UPDATE)
       DT   01-MAR-1989  (REL. 10, LAST ANNOTATION UPDATE)


       2.3   Extension of  the taxonomic  classification in the OC
       lines

       In  previous   releases  of  SWISS-PROT  the  OC  (Organism
       Classification) lines  only contained the first node of the
       taxonomic tree (PROKARYOTA, EUKARYOTA or VIRIDAE). Starting
       with release  10  we  are  implementing  a  full  taxonomic
       classification. In  release  10,  164  different  taxonomic
       nodes have  been  defined.  The  list  of  these  nodes  is
       available in the SPECLIST.TXT document file.

       2.4  New topic for the comments (CC) line type

       As of  release 10  we have  added a  new  'topic'  for  the
       comments  (CC)   line-type:  COFACTOR,  which  is  used  to
       describe enzyme cofactor(s). Example of its usage:

         CC   -!- COFACTOR: REQUIRES PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE.


       2.5  New feature key

       A new  feature key  has been  introduced in  this  release:
       TRANSIT, which  describes the  extent of  a transit peptide
       (mitochondrial or  chloroplastic). Examples  of TRANSIT key
       feature lines:

         FT   TRANSIT       1     25       MITOCHONDRION.
         FT   TRANSIT       1     42       CHLOROPLAST.


       3. THE NEXT RELEASE

       SWISS-PROT release 11.0 will be available in June 1989.


       4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

       We welcome any feedback from our users. We especially would
       appreciate that  you notify  us if  you find that sequences
       belonging to  your field  of expertise are missing from the
       data  bank.  We  also  would  like  to  be  notified  about
       annotations to  be updated,  as for example if the function
       of  a   protein  has   been  clarified   or  if  new  post-
       translational information has become available.
