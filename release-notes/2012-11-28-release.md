# Headline

RALF, a growing family of plant peptide hormones

The [first plant peptide hormone](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17751827) to be identified was [systemin](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P27058). Systemin regulates systemic wound signaling during herbivore and pathogen attacks. Since its discovery in 1991, [several other polypeptide signals have been reported in plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16669777), including [phytosulfokines](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=name:phytosulfokine*+AND+reviewed:true) and

CLAVATA3 and

CLAVATA3 -related proteins .

In 2001, [Pearce et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11675511) used a cell suspension culture assay to identify polypeptide hormones in plant extracts that cause alkalinization of the medium. In addition to systemins, the authors isolated a 5-kDa polypeptide from tobacco leaves that induced rapid alkalinization of the culture medium and the concomitant activation of an intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase. The peptide has been called

RALF for Rapid ALkalinization Factor. The 49-amino acid long active peptide is produced by processing of a 115 amino acid long preprotein. Genes encoding

RALF preproproteins are expressed in various tissues and organs in many different plant species. In _Arabidopsis thaliana_, the

RALF family consists of [36 members](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=family:%22plant+rapid+alkalinization+factor+%28RALF%29+family%22+and+organism_id:3702). As in tobacco, they are produced by the processing of precursors containing signal peptides and, for some of them, the cleavage of an additional propeptide is required. The presence of disulfide bonds contributes to their stabilization after secretion. One member of the family,

RALF1, has been shown to induce an [intracellular Ca(2+) increase](https://www.uniprot.org/:http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18494498), likely caused by both Ca(2+) influx across the plasma membrane and release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. This mechanism could be common to other RALFs.

Further studies are needed for a better understanding of

RALF functions, but as of this release, all [_Arabidopsis thaliana_ RALF family members](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=family:%22plant+rapid+alkalinization+factor+%28RALF%29+family%22+and+organism_id:3702+AND+reviewed:true) have been manually annotated with all available information.

## Cross-references to PaxDb

Cross-references have been added to PaxDb (Protein Abundance Across Organisms), a comprehensive absolute protein abundance database, which contains whole genome protein abundance information across organisms.

PaxDb is available at [http://pax-db.org](http://pax-db.org/#!home)

## New format of the documentation files yeast.txt, yeast chromosome files, pombe.txt and calbican.txt

UniProtKB provides documentation files for [some key species](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/#species). These files list the relevant UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries with information like the primary accession number and entry name, gene designations, protein length, cross-references to organism-specific databases and whether a 3D structure is available or not.

We have slightly changed the file format so that all information from one protein is now found on a single line, which should make it easier to parse these files.

The following files are affected by this change:

[Yeast](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/yeast)
