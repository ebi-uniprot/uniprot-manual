IFNE

[Interferons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon) (IFNs) are proteins made and released in answer to the presence of pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, that trigger the protective defenses of the immune system. In other words, they “interfere” with infections, hence their name. Within the large

IFN family, type I IFNs are clustered on a defined locus on [chromosome 9p21 in humans and in a region of conserved synteny on chromosome 4 in mice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15233997). Their expression is induced by the activation of signaling pathways downstream of pattern-recognition receptors and they all bind to the

IFN -alpha cell surface receptor complex consisting of

IFNAR1 and

IFNAR2 chains, leading to the expression of a whole set of genes.

There is, however, an alien on the type

I IFN locus:

IFN -epsilon (IFNE).

IFNE shares less than 40% amino acid identity with bona fide type I IFNs, such as

IFN -alpha or

IFN -beta, but it does still bind to

IFNAR, as expected for a type

I IFN. However, unlike any of the other family members, [it is not induced by the activation of any known pattern-recognition, including Toll-like receptor pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23449591). In addition, while other type I IFNs are mainly produced by haemopoietic cells,

IFNE is constitutively expressed by epithelial cells of the female reproductive tract in humans and mice. At first glance, these observations seem to challenge a potential protective function for

IFNE .

In a [recent publication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23449591), Fung et al. reported that

IFNE expression varied approximately 30-fold at different stages of the estrous cycle in the mouse uterus, with the highest levels at estrus (when estrogen levels are high) and was reduced during pregnancy (when progesterone levels are high). Similarly, in the human endometrium,

IFNE levels were highest in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle and lowest in postmenopausal women (when estrogen levels are low). The suspected hormonal regulation could then be confirmed in mice and in humans:

IFNE is induced by estrogens and reduced by progesterone. What about

IFNE function? Fung et al. demonstrated that

IFNE regulates

IFN -regulated genes, including

IRF7 and

ISG15, as well as 2’5’oligoadenylate synthetase. What is more, _Ifne-/-_ female mice, whose vaginas were infected with _Chlamydia muridarum_ or herpes simplex virus 2, had more severe clinical disease than wild-type mice, as well as higher levels of virus or bacteria at defined time points after infection. Hence

IFNE seems to play an important – though local – protective role against sexually transmitted infections.

These very interesting observations may have pinpointed the cause of susceptibility to infections of the reproductive tract in women on progesterone-containing contraception, i.e. a progesterone-induced decrease in

IFNE expression.

In UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot,

IFNE entries have been updated accordingly.

# UniProtKB news

## Cross-references to GeneWiki

Cross-references have been added to [GeneWiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wiki), an initiative that aims to create seed articles for every notable human gene.

GeneWiki is available at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wiki>

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>GeneWiki</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>GeneWiki identifier</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><p>Q96N67 :</p><pre><code>DR   GeneWiki; Dock7; -.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Change of the cross-reference GlycoSuiteDB to UniCarbKB

GlycoSuiteDB, an annotated and curated relational database of glycan structures, has been integrated into [UniCarbKB](http://www.unicarbkb.org/), with a new user interface and added functionalities.

We therefore changed the corresponding resource abbreviation from GlycoSuiteDB to UniCarbKB.

Example:

P02763 :

Previous flat file format:

    DR   GlycoSuiteDB; P02763; -.

New flat file format:

    DR   UniCarbKB; P02763; -.

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is currently linked to this resource from the cross-reference section (DR lines), but we also have some site-specific links from the sequence annotation section (FT

CARBOHYD ) of [relevant UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=annotation%3A%28type%3Acarbohyd+CAR_*%29). An increase of the number of cross-linked entries is planned, including more literature based glycan data from UniCarbKB.

## Removal of the cross-reference to GermOnline

Cross-references to GermOnline have been removed.
