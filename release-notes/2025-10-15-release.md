## Introduction of explicit links between citations and their retraction notice in UniProt RDF

In the UniProt RDF format, a rectracted citation was previously flagged as such by the presence of a [`up:scope`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/scope) statement with a "RETRACTED" literal value on the reified [`up:citation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/citation) statement that links the UniProtKB entry to that citation. Similarly, a [`up:scope`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/scope) statement with a literal value starting with "RETRACTION NOTICE OF PUBMED:" was previously found on the reified [`up:citation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/citation) statement that links the UniProtKB entry to the corresponding rectraction notice.

In order to represent the relationship between retracted citations and their retraction notices in a clearer way, we have removed those [`up:scope`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/scope) statements, and directly linked a retracted citation to its rectraction notice using a new `up:retractionNotice` predicate.

Example: [P21457](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P21457.ttl)

Previous format:

```

  skos:exactMatch pubmed:8430337 .

<#_P21457-citation-8430337>
  a rdf:Statement ;
