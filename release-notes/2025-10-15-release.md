## The strange case of the Cheetah and Leopard proteomes

The [Reference Proteomes](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes?query=proteome_type%3A1) (RPs) provided by UniProt aim to represent the best protein set from each organism in the Tree of Life. Ideally, all species should have an RP, in order to direct the scientific community to the best proteins for that taxon. We have created a novel workflow to select RPs that accomplishes this. Take, for example, the Cheetah and the Leopard proteomes: both of these animals belong to the family Felidae, and their proteomes are very alike. Our previous method for selecting RPs found them to be so similar that it resulted in only the Cheetah having an RP, and the Leopard proteome being represented by the Cheetah. With our novel workflow, we ensure a more comprehensive and robust method is used to select RPs for each species, resulting in the [Cheetah](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP001652583) and the [Leopard](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP001165780) each having its own RP. In total, we are improving the coverage of RPs in the Tree of Life by 34%. With all species having at least 1 RP, UniProt is setting a standard in the scientific community for the best set of proteins (Fig.1). Going forward, the unreviewed section of the UniProt Knowledgebase ([UniProtKB](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb)/TrEMBL) is going to be solely composed of proteins from RPs, and an additional limited number of biologically interesting proteins. No reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries will be deleted in this context. This new set of proteomes was selected and made public in release 2025_04 and the removal of non-RP proteins from UniProtKB/TrEMBL will be completed by release 2026_02. All protein sequences will still be accessible in [UniParc](https://www.uniprot.org/uniparc).

# UniProtKB news

# UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot not updated in release 2025_04

For technical reasons, Swiss-Prot was not updated in release 2025_04. Reviewed entries published with release 2025_04 remain unchanged from release 2025_03. Pending updates will appear in the next release.

# RDF news

## Introduction of explicit links between citations and their retraction notice in UniProt RDF

In the UniProt RDF format, a rectracted citation was previously flagged as such by the presence of a [`up:scope`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/scope) statement with a "RETRACTED" literal value on the reified [`up:citation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/citation) statement that links the UniProtKB entry to that citation. Similarly, a [`up:scope`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/scope) statement with a literal value starting with "RETRACTION NOTICE OF PUBMED:" was previously found on the reified [`up:citation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/citation) statement that links the UniProtKB entry to the corresponding rectraction notice.

In order to represent the relationship between retracted citations and their retraction notices in a clearer way, we have removed those [`up:scope`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/scope) statements, and directly linked a retracted citation to its rectraction notice using a new `up:retractionNotice` predicate.

Example: [P21457](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P21457.ttl)

Previous format:
