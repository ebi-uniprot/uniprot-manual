CIA : on your Genome service

[Life evolved in an anaerobic world](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18173371) and it is thought that iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters played a crucial role in this process by facilitating chemical transformations. Once photosynthesis evolved, oxygen became prevalent, threatening Fe-S clusters as they are susceptible to destruction by oxidation. Despite this potential problem, Fe-S clusters are still cofactors in hundreds of [proteins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=reviewed:true+AND+keyword:KW-0411). They are [required in virtually all organisms from bacteria to humans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22798587) and are involved not only in ‘redox’ catalysis in some enzymes, but also in many other functions. Interestingly, Fe-S clusters have been found in many proteins involved in

DNA repair and replication and telomere length maintenance.

In eukaryotic cells, most biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters occurs in the mitochondria, but it may also occur in the cytosol and nucleus. In the cytosol, Fe-S clusters are escorted and presented to their cytoplasmic and nuclear apoproteins by the conserved cytoplasmic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery. However, it is not clear how Fe-S clusters are transferred to target apoproteins, nor how target specificity is achieved.

[Two recent and elegant publications](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22678361,22678362) have shown that the

MMS19 protein is associated with the

CIA machinery. This protein also binds a subset of cellular Fe-S proteins, specifically nuclear ones involved in

DNA metabolism, including the

DNA helicases

RTEL1,

ERCC2 and

ERCC3 .

MMS19 is required for in vivo incorporation of iron into various

DNA repair enzymes and, in the absence of

MMS19, cells become more sensitive to

DNA damage. The authors suggest that

MMS19 functions as a platform to facilitate Fe-S cluster transfer to proteins critical for

DNA replication and repair. These experiments point to the importance of Fe-S clusters for the maintenance of genome integrity and

imply a central role for mitochondria in genomic

DNA metabolism .

In spite of their interest, we might have missed these publications, if not for one of our users who contacted us asking for their review and integration into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. We immensely value feedback and update requests and we would like to thank all users who are taking time to help us improve UniProtKB. If you would like to contribute, please use ‘Send feedback’ button in the clickable box found at the top-right corner of each entry and we will handle your request with high priority.
