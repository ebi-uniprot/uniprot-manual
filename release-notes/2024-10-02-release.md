## Plasma membrane rupture during cell death: from a passive hypothesis to an active process

Many forms of programmed and regulated cell death are known. They can be triggered by numerous stimuli and use different mechanisms to achieve their goals. Pyroptosis, for instance, is an inflammatory form of lytic programmed cell death, triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as the high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) (a chromatin-associated protein), as well as heat-shock proteins, uric acid, or ATP, or by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like the prototypical bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Pyroptosis activates inflammasomes, which in turn promote the activation of inflammatory caspases, such as caspase-1. Caspase-1 activation culminates in the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines, typically [IL1B](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=gene:il1B<ins>taxonomy_name:mammalia) and [IL18](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=gene:il18</ins>taxonomy_name:mammalia). Upon activation by caspase-dependent cleavage, [gasdermin-D](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=gene:GSDMD+taxonomy_name:mammalia) targets the plasma membrane and forms pores, via which IL1B and IL18 are released. Pore formation also results in sodium and then water influx which raises osmotic pressure and ultimately leads to plasma membrane rupture (PMR). Hence this very last step of lytic cell death is a passive event. At least this is what was generally thought for a quite long time, but Nature often surprises us. In 2021, [Nayagaki et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472215/) showed that inflammasome-induced PMR was not a passive process, but actively executed by ninjurin-1 protein (NINJ1). The role of NINJ1 in PMR is not limited to pyroptosis, but it also plays a role in other forms of cell death, including [necroptosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472215/), [ferroptosis, parthanatos, and H~2~O~2~-induced necrosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37980412,38396301).

[NINJ1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=gene:ninj1+taxonomy_name:vertebrata) was originally identified as being [up-regulated both in Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons following nerve injury](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8780658,9261151), hence its name: ninjurin-1 standing for Nerve INJURy-INduced protein. It is a small (only some 150 amino acid-long) cell surface protein, which is predicted to contain two transmembrane helices (called alpha 3 and 4) and two other alpha-helices in the N-terminus, called alpha 1 and 2. Both N- and C-termini of the protein are located in the extracellular space. During pyroptosis, [NINJ1 polymerizes into filaments](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37198476,38614101), organizing adjacent protomers in a fence-like manner. The two antiparallel transmembrane helices alpha 3 and 4 form the core of the filament. The two N-terminal helices alpha 1 and 2 are rearranged and insert into the membrane. The alpha 2 helix adopts a parallel orientation with respect to alpha 3 and 4, while alpha 1 protrudes at a nearly 90Â° angle and connects to the adjacent protomer. The filament forms rings within the lipid bilayer, with a hydrophobic side (formed by helices apha 3 and 4) and a hydrophilic side (formed by helices 1 and 2). [Several models](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38906725/) have been proposed to explain the mechanism of PMR. Single filaments could oligomerize, pushing lipids away with the hydrophilic face of the protein. Alternatively, a double filament could form which could then open outwards as if being 'unzipped'. Finally, NINJ1 could oligomerize into closed, circular-like structures with the hydrophilic side facing the outside of the ring and the hydrophobic side facing the interior, leading to the ['solubilization' of the encircled membrane](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.31.543175v1), reminiscent of the action of a ['cookie cutter'](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38614101/), that would release membrane disks. This latter hypothesis seems to fit best most current experimental observations.

Besides the exact mechanism, the trigger that induces NINJ1 activation is also unknown, as well as many other aspects. Could NINJ1 be targeted to reduce inflammation in human diseases? NINJ1 has a close homolog, NINJ2, that forms filaments, but is unable to induce PMR, why? These questions and many others will have to be answered. Meanwhile, we have updated [NINJ1 entries](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=gene:ninj1+taxonomy_name:vertebrata) in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and they are now publicly available.
