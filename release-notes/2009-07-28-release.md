## Microsporidian polar tube: a molecular syringe in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

[Microsporidia](http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2006/Microsporidiosis/microsporidia1.html) are ubiquitous, obligate intracellular spore-forming fungal parasites which infect a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates. They are common pathogens responsible for opportunistic infections in immunodeficient humans, such as HIV-infected patients or patients being treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The most common microsporidian associated with AIDS is [_Enterocytozoon bieneusi_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/481877) which induces chronic diarrhea in HIV-infected individuals. However, since no animal model for _E.bieneusi_ is available, most of the experimental studies on microsporidia have been carried out on [_Encephalitozoon cuniculi_](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/6035). This microsporidium, which commonly infects rodents, has also been reported to infect humans. Its [complete proteome](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=organism_name:Encephalitozoon+cuniculi+AND+keyword:Complete+proteome) is available in UniProtKB.

Microsporidia are primitive organisms lacking fundamental organelles found in other eukaryotes, such as stacked Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes or mitochondria. However, they have a mitochondrial relic organelle called the mitosome which does not contain any DNA. As a result, to persist in the environment, they have to parasitize the cells of higher organisms.

How do they achieve their goal? The microsporidian intracellular developmental cycle leads to a terminal sporogenic phase producing small spores which are critical for their host-to-host transmission. The unicellular spores have a resistant wall protecting a mononucleate or binucleate sporoplasm (the infectious apparatus of the spore) and an extrusion apparatus consisting of a single polar tube with an anterior attachment complex. Once the target cell is recognized, the polar tube acts as a syringe: it pierces the host cell membrane and rapidly "injects" the sporoplasm into the host cell.

3 polar tube proteins have been identified: [PTP1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O76942), [PTP2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8SRT0), and [PTP3](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8MTP3). The major polar tube protein, [PTP1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O76942), accounts for at least 70% of the mass of the polar tube. Before the polar tube can act, the spore has to recognize the host cell and stick to its surface. This role is played by [EnP1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8SWL3), which is involved in the adhesion of spores to host cell surface glycoaminoglycans. Orthologous proteins have been identified: [EnP1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A7TZU4), [PTP1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q5F2J0) and [PTP2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q5F2J0) in [_Encephalitozoon intestinalis_](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/58839) and [PTP1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O76273) and [PTP2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0CAT5) in [_Encephalitozoon hellem_](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/27973). These 2 microsporidian species infect man and cause intestinal infections keratoconjunctivitis, and respiratory infections.

All these infectious proteins are available in UniProtKB with the following accession numbers:

## Cross-references to CTD

Cross-references have been added to the [Comparative Toxicogenomics Database](http://ctd.mdibl.org/), which elucidates molecular mechanisms by which environmental chemicals affect human disease. Chemical-gene/protein interactions and chemical- and gene-disease relationships are curated from the published literature, and integrated with diverse data to facilitate environmental health research.

CTD is available at <http://ctd.mdibl.org/> .

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>CTD</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>NCBI geneID.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>Q9YIC3:

## Cross-references to Ensembl

We have changed the format of the cross-reference lines to Ensembl. The DR Ensembl lines have been extended in order to include identifiers for transcripts and peptides.

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 29%" /><col style="width: 70%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>Ensembl</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Ensembl unique identifier for a transcript.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>Ensembl unique identifier for a protein.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Optional information 2</td><td>Ensembl unique identifier for a gene.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 3</td><td>Species name.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>O43462:
