## Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive model bacterium fully annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

We are all aware of the importance of model bacterial systems. [_Escherichia coli_ K12](http://www.ecogene.org/) is the paradigm for Gram-negative bacteria, but what of Gram-positive bacteria? There are a large variety of these bacteria that serve us, are neutral or infect us, and model systems for these bacteria are in demand.

[_Bacillus subtilis_](http://genodb.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/WebObjects/GenoList.woa/wa/goToTaxoRank?level=Bacillus%20subtilis%20168), a rod-shaped, soil-and water-dwelling bacterium originally described as _Vibrio subtilis_ in 1835 by Ehrenberg and renamed in 1872 by Cohn has served this role for over a century. _B.subtilis_ differentiates to produce endospores, can be made naturally competent for DNA uptake and is a bacteriophage host. In the wild it has been seen to produce over 2 dozen different antibiotics. These characteristics make it an obvious choice as a model system for bacterial differentiation and genetics, as well as a model for other - often more dangerous - bacteria such as _Bacillus anthracis_, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or _Staphylococcus aureus_. Additionally, it is used for the production of various industrially interesting enzymes such as amylases and proteases. A substrain, _B.subtilis natto_, is used to prepare natto, a traditional Japanese dish made from fermented soybeans. Although _B.subtilis_ is not considered pathogenic for any known organism, it has been isolated from patients suffering from various illness such as endocarditis, pneumonia etc., and also occasionally from spoiled food where it might be responsible for cases of food poisoning.

The genome of _B.subtilis_ 168, a widely used laboratory strain, was sequenced by a large international consortium in 1997 - the 6th bacterium to be fully sequenced. The sequence was updated and reannotated in 2009 by the Institut Pasteur and the Génoscope. In coordination with them we have annotated the complete proteome, providing all 4'192 _B.subtilis_ proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, each of which has a cross-reference to the dedicated _B.subtilis_ database [SubtiList/GenoList](http://genodb.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/WebObjects/GenoList.woa/wa/goToTaxoRank?level=Bacillus%20subtilis%20168) as well as other databases. A list of all _B.subtilis_ UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries is available in the [bacsu.txt](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/bacsu) file. This of course provides a snapshot of the knowledge about this first fully manually annotated Gram-positive model organism and will date easily. Despite having been so intently studied for so long, there are many _B.subtilis_ proteins about which we know very little. There will be work for years to come for the _B.subtilis_ (and larger scientific) community as these proteins and their homologues are characterized.

[All _B.subtilis_ entries](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=organism_id:1423+AND+keyword:KW-0181) can be retrieved from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot combining the organism name "Bacillus subtilis" (or the taxonomy identifier 1423) with the keyword 'Complete proteome' (organism_name:"Bacillus subtilis" AND keyword:"Complete proteome" or organism_id:1423 AND keyword:KW-0181).

## Cross-references to EuPathDB

Cross-references have been added to the Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Resources [EuPathDB](http://www.eupathdb.org/) (formerly ApiDB), an integrated database covering the eukaryotic pathogens of the genera Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Leishmania, Neospora, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Trichomonas and Trypanosoma. While each of these groups is supported by a taxon-specific database built upon the same infrastructure, the EuPathDB portal offers an entry point to all these resources ("child databases": e.g. ToxoDB, PlasmoDB, CryptoDB...), and the opportunity to leverage orthology for searches across genera.

EuPathDB is available at <http://www.eupathdb.org/> .

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 25%" /><col style="width: 75%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>EuPathDB</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Combination of the child database name and the accession number in this database concatenated by a ":".</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Examples</td><td><pre><code>P84155:

## Cross-references to ProtClustDB

Cross-references have been added to Entrez Protein Clusters [ProtClustDB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=proteinclusters), a collection of related protein sequences (clusters) which consists of Reference Sequence proteins encoded by complete genomes. This database contains both curated and non-curated clusters. The Protein Clusters database provides easy access to annotation information, publications, domains, structures, and external links and analysis tools including multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees, and genomic neighborhoods (ProtMap).

ProtClustDB is available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=proteinclusters> .

## Cross-references to SUPFAM

Cross-references have been added to the Superfamily database of structural and functional annotation [SUPFAM](http://supfam.org), a database of structural and functional annotation for all proteins and genomes. The SUPFAM annotation is based on a collection of hidden Markov models, which represent structural protein domains at the SCOP superfamily level. A superfamily groups together domains which have an evolutionary relationship. The annotation is produced by scanning protein sequences from over 1,200 completely sequenced genomes against the hidden Markov models.

SUPFAM is available at <http://supfam.org> .

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 41%" /><col style="width: 58%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>SUPFAM</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>SUPFAM superfamily identifier.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>SUPFAM superfamily domain name.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Optional information 2</td><td>Number of hits found.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Examples</td><td><pre><code>P08519:
