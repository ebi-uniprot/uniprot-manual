### Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). For the feature key [MOD\_RES](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/mod_res), the new introduced controlled vocabularies for PTMs [(PTMlist.txt)](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist) are:

-   Methylation: All entries with annotated methylation sites have the keyword [Methylation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0488) .

         N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-5-hydroxylysine
         N6-poly(methylaminopropyl)lysine

-   Hydroxylation: All entries with annotated hydroxylation sites have the keyword [Hydroxylation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0379) .

         3-hydroxyproline
         4-hydroxyarginine

-   Unidentified N-terminal blocking modifications:

         Blocked amino end (Leu)

-   Other new controlled vocabularies for PTMs that are annotated with the feature key MOD\_RES:

         Glycine radical (Keyword: Organic radical)
         Pentaglycyl murein peptidoglycan amidated alanine (Keyword: Peptidoglycan-anchor)
         Tryptophylquinone
