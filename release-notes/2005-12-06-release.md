## 200'000 entries in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

The Swiss-Prot group is happy to announce that a total number of 200'000 manually annotated entries has been reached in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. It took 15 years and 2 months to reach the first 100'000 entries in September 2001, but only 4 years and 2 months to reach 200'000 entries. The first ([P99999](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P99999)) and the 200'000th ([Q52V10](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q52V10)) entries deal with human and common squirrel monkey cytochrome c, respectively. Both were created by Amos Bairoch, who founded the knowledgebase, the first in July 1986 and the last in November 2005.

We would like to acknowledge our users, who provide continous support by suggesting entry updates, by sharing their expertise in order to increase annotation quality or simply by using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

Many thanks also to all annotators, programmers, system administrators, administrative support persons, members of the UniProt Consortium, who have contributed to this major achievement.
