                             1. INTRODUCTION

       1.1  Evolution

       Release 11.0 of SWISS-PROT contains 10856 sequence entries,
       comprising 3'265'966  amino  acids  abstracted  from  10775
       references. This  represents an increase of 9% over release
       10.0. The  recent growth  of the  data bank  is  summarised
       below:

       1.2  Source of data

       Release 11.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data
       from  release  20.0  of  the  PIR  (Protein  Identification
       Resource) protein  data bank,  as well  as  translation  of
       nucleotide sequence  data from  release 19.0  of  the  EMBL
       nucleotide sequence Data Library.

       As an  indication to the source of the sequence data in the
       SWISS-PROT data bank we list here the statistics concerning
       the DR (Databank Reference) pointer lines:

       Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):          2992
       Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):         3875
       Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es): 3272
       Entries with no pointers lines (entered in house):       717



         2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE
                               RELEASE 10


       2.1  Sequences and annotations

       Some 848  new sequences  have been  added  since  the  last
       release, the sequence data of 113 existing entries has been
       updated and  the annotations  of  1366  entries  have  been
       revised. In  particular we  have used  reviews articles  to
       update the  annotations of the following groups or families
       of proteins:

          Adenylate kinases
          Bacterial restriction systems proteins
          Bacterial transduction systems proteins
          Caseins
          Chitin-binding proteins
          Cutinases
          Cytochromes P450
          DNA polymerases
          DNA topoisomerases type I
          Esterases
          Heat shock hsp70 proteins
          Lipases
          Microtubule-associated proteins
          2-oxo acid dehydrogenases complex components
          Paramyxoviruses proteins
          Protein disulfide isomerases
          Purine/pyrimidine phosphoribosyl transferases
          Rhabdoviruses proteins
          Ribonucleotide reductases
          Rotaviruses proteins
          Serine hydroxymethyltransferases
          Small, acid-soluble spore proteins
          Xylose isomerases


       2.2  Standardized journal abbreviations

       Journal  names   are  now   abbreviated  according  to  the
       conventions  used  by  the  National  Library  of  Medicine
       (Washington D.C.,  USA) and  are based  on the existing ISO
       and ANSI  standards. In  most cases  the changes are small,
       and the  new abbreviations  are at  least as  meaningful as
       the old ones. As in previous releases the abbreviations for
       the journals cited in SWISS-PROT are listed in the document
       file JOURLIST.TXT


       2.3  New feature key

       A new  feature key  has been  introduced in  this  release:
       THIOETH, which  describes  a  thioether  bond  between  two
       residues.



                           3. THE NEXT RELEASE

       SWISS-PROT release 12.0 will be available in November 1989.




                         4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

       We welcome any feedback from our users. We especially would
       appreciate that  you notify  us if  you find that sequences
       belonging to  your field  of expertise are missing from the
       data  bank.  We  also  would  like  to  be  notified  about
       annotations to  be updated,  as for example if the function
       of  a   protein  has   been  clarified   or  if  new  post-
       translational information has become available.

       B.2  IBM PS/2 1.4 Mb disks

       The number  and content  of the  1.4 Mb  disks for the PS/2
       systems are  exactly identical to those of the 1.2 Mb disks
       (see above).
