## The culprit for extreme morning sickness identified

[Most women experience nausea and vomiting during pregnancy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22190950/). Some of them (0.3-3%) develop a severe form, called hyperemesis gravidarum. A real nightmare! Not only does it disrupt everyday activities, but it affects eating, drinking and therefore can cause dehydration, nutrient deficiencies and weight loss. It frequently leads to hospitalization, and, at its most extreme, can result in the termination of pregnancy and maternal death. This phenotype has been known for centuries, but its cause remained elusive.

In 2018, two loci were associated with hyperemesis gravidarum by genome-wide association studies, one of them included [GDF15](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q99988). This association made sense. GDF15 is a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family member, which was already suggested to be [a key driver of cachexia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27239403/) and [weight loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26672741/) in cancer patients. It is a plasma protein that binds and activates a heterodimeric receptor made of [GFRAL](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q6UXV0) and [RET](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P07949). The expression of this receptor is restricted to brainstem areas, which control vomiting and [are critical for the regulation of food intake and body weight](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24971956/).

We all produce low levels of GDF15. GDF15 expression and secretion is increased by exposure to various toxins or tissue injury of many kinds. [The activation of GDF15 receptor in the brainstem leads to aversive response, anorexia, nausea and reduced movement](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195860/). Through this action, GDF15 may not only prevent the ingestion of foodborne toxins, but also favor healing after injury by forcing the injured individual to rest. What happens during pregnancy? During the first 12 weeks, GDF15 protein levels increase in the maternal blood. [The vast majority (over 99%) of GDF15 in the maternal plasma comes from the fetus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38092039/). Through its action, GDF15 may protect both mother and fetus from food-borne illness and toxins, particularly important at a time when the fetus is most susceptible to teratogens and the immunosuppressed state of early pregnancy makes mothers susceptible to infections.

[GDF15 levels are significantly higher in women experiencing nausea and vomiting compared to women who do not](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38092039/). However, all GDF15 variants that raise the risk of hyperemesis gravidarum are actually associated with reduced plasma GDF15 in the non-pregnant state, like for instance the well-studied variant p.Cys211Gly that reduces GDF15 secretion. Conversely, chronic high levels of GDF15, such as those seen in individuals with beta-thalassemia, seem to protect against hyperemesis gravidarum. In this population, only 5% of pregnant women report nausea or vomiting, compared to over 60% in an ethnically and age-matched control group. This ties in with observations made in a very different context,
 namely cigarette smoking, where it has been reported that [prepregnancy cigarette smoking, a behavior associated with elevated GDF15, reduces the risk of hyperemesis gravidarum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27123776/). This suggests agonist-induced desensitization, a feature observed for many hormone receptor systems. Indeed, in response to a bolus of GDF15, mice show a major reduction in food intake and lose weight, but [animals that were previously exposed to GDF15 have a markedly blunted response](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38092039/).

This discovery might have clinical implications and after the [thalidomide](https://www.uniprot.org/release-notes/2015-01-07-release) tragedy, represent a new hope for safe medication. Women at risk for hyperemesis gravidarum, i.e. producing low levels of GDF15, could be given increasingly high doses of the hormone while trying to conceive, to desensitize them to it.

The [updated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot GDF15 entry](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q99988) is available as of this release.
