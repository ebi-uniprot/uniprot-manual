# RDF news

## Change of URIs for the PROSITE database in RDF

For historic reasons, UniProt had to generate URIs to cross-reference databases that did not have an RDF representation or did not provide stable URIs such as [PURLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator) (permanent uniform resource locators). The SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics has now committed to provide stable URIs for the resources that it supports. [PROSITE](https://prosite.expasy.org/) is now also using this service, therefore we have changed the PROSITE URIs accordingly:

The links to PROSITE signatures (used in UniProtKB cross-references and in UniParc) change from:

```
http://purl.uniprot.org/prosite/PS50835
```
to:
```
https://purl.expasy.org/prosite/signature/PS50835
```

The links to PROSITE annotation rules (aka: ProRule as used in UniProtKB attributions) change from:
```
http://purl.uniprot.org/prosite-prorule/PRU00114
```
to:
```
https://purl.expasy.org/prosite/rule/PRU00114
```

## Change of URIs for taxonomic ranks in RDF

The NCBI [replaced the taxonomic rank 'Superkingdom' by the new ranks 'Domain' and 'Realm'](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2025/02/27/new-ranks-ncbi-taxonomy/). We use this opportunity to change the URIs of all ranks by adding the prefix `Taxonomic_Rank_` to add context to terms like 'Domain' that can have several meanings in the context of UniProt. For instance,

```
<owl:Thing rdf:about="http://purl.uniprot.org/core/Species">
```

changes to:
```
<owl:Thing rdf:about="http://purl.uniprot.org/core/Taxonomic_Rank_Species">
```
