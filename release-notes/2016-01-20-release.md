# Headline

## cGAMP, a welcome stowaway

We are often amazed by the strategies deployed by viruses to trick our defences, but our immune system does not lag behind and it can also fool viral invaders. The detection of viruses by the innate immune system relies on the detection of intracellular DNA by pattern recognition receptors, including cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase ( [cGAS](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=gene:mb21d1+AND+reviewed:true), also called MB21D1). In response to cytosolic DNA, this enzyme synthesizes 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which then binds to [STING](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=gene:tmem173+AND+reviewed:true) (also called TMEM173), an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein, leading to the activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response, thereby inducing an antiviral state.

Last year, [Gentili et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229115) made a puzzling observation. To study cGAS function, they transduced human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with a cGAS-expressing lentivirus. As expected, the cells were strongly activated, but the stimulatory property of the cGAS-encoding lentivirus did not correlate with the transduction efficiency. This led to the hypothesis that it was not cGAS itself that was responsible for the activation of the infected cells, but some other stimulatory signal, which was transferred by the viral vector. Indeed, when dendritic cells were challenged with virus-like particles (VLPs) that did not themselves encode cGAS, but were produced in the presence of cGAS, the cells were stimulated. This effect was abolished when VLPs were produced in the presence of a catalytically inactive cGAS mutant. Concomitantly, [Bridgeman et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229117) found that the incubation of macrophages, epithelial cells or lung fibroblasts with lentiviral particles collected from cells overexpressing cGAS led to the STING-dependent up-regulation of type I interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. All this evidence pointed to cGAMP as the stimulatory signal and indeed both groups identified the dinucleotide in the viral particles, by mass spectrometry, not only in their experimental system, but also in more physiological settings, using a herpes virus (MCMV) and a poxvirus (Modified Vaccinia Anakara virus). It is yet unclear whether the incorporation of cGAMP into virus particles is a selective host-directed process or simply a consequence of random fluid-phase uptake of cytosolic material into viral particles.

cGAMP has [previously been shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24077100) to diffuse through gap junctions, thereby alerting non-infected neighboring cells to pathogen threat. The discovery by Gentili et al. and Bridgeman et al. suggests that cells located far from the initial infection site may also benefit from cGAMP transfer and initiate rapid antiviral responses bypassing the need for cGAS activation.

Although the downstream fate of the dinucleotide does not directly depend on cGAS enzyme activity, this piece of information has been introduced into [cGAS](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=gene:mb21d1+AND+reviewed:true) entries as of this release.

## Cross-references to CollecTF

Cross-references have been added to the CollecTF database of bacterial transcription factor binding sites. CollecTF stores data on experimentally-validated TFBS and places special emphasis on providing a transparent curation process that captures the experimental support for sites as reported by authors in peer-reviewed publications.

CollecTF is available at <http://www.collectf.org> .

The format of the explicit links is:
