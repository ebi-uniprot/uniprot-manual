                             1. Introduction


    TrEMBL is a computer-annotated protein sequence database supplementing the
    SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence Data Bank. TrEMBL contains the translations of
    all coding sequences (CDS) present in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
    not yet integrated in SWISS-PROT. TrEMBL can be considered as a preliminary
    section of SWISS-PROT. For all TrEMBL entries which should finally be
    upgraded to the standard SWISS-PROT quality, SWISS-PROT accession numbers
    have been assigned.

                            2. Why a supplement to SWISS-PROT?

    The ongoing gene sequencing and mapping projects have dramatically
    increased the number of protein sequences to be incorporated into SWISS-PROT.
    We do not want to dilute the quality standards of SWISS-PROT by incorporating
    sequences without proper sequence analysis and annotation, but we do want to
    make the sequences available as fast as possible. TrEMBL achieves this second
    goal, and is a major step in the process of speeding up subsequent
    upgrading of annotation to the standard SWISS-PROT quality.
    To address the problem of redundancy, the translations of all coding
    sequences (CDS) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included
    in SWISS-PROT have been removed from TrEMBL.

    We name this supplement TrEMBL (Translation from EMBL), since the tools
    used to create the translations of the CDS are based on the program
    'trembl' written by Thure Etzold at the EMBL.

                                 3. The Release

    This TrEMBL release was created from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
    release 58 and contains 244'862 sequence entries, comprising 66'562'800 amino
    acids. To minimize redundancy, the translations of all coding sequences (CDS)
    in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included in SWISS-PROT 37
    have been removed from TrEMBL release 10.

    TrEMBL is split in two main sections: SP-TrEMBL and REM-TrEMBL:

    SP-TrEMBL (SWISS-PROT TrEMBL) contains the entries (201'082) which should be
    eventually incorporated into SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT accession numbers have
    been assigned for all SP-TrEMBL entries.

    SP-TrEMBL is organized in subsections:

    arc.dat (Archea):               7408 entries
    fun.dat (Fungi):                6679 entries
    hum.dat (Human):                8518 entries
    inv.dat (Invertebrates):       23653 entries
    mam.dat (Other Mammals):        3130 entries
    mhc.dat (MHC proteins):         4236 entries
    org.dat (Organelles):          16261 entries
    phg.dat (Bacteriophages):       1971 entries
    pln.dat (Plants):              17352 entries
    pro.dat (Prokaryotes):         45992 entries
    rod.dat (Rodents):              7480 entries
    unc.dat (Unclassified):           44 entries
    vrl.dat (Viruses):             53916 entries
    vrt.dat (Other Vertebrates):    4442 entries

    25166 new entries have been integrated in SP-TrEMBL. The sequences of
    894 SP-TrEMBL entries have been updated and the annotation has been updated in
    57'510 entries.

    In the document deleteac.txt, you will find a list of all accession numbers
    which were previously present in TrEMBL, but which have now been deleted from
    the database.

    REM-TrEMBL (REMaining TrEMBL) contains the entries (43'780) that we do
    not want to include in SWISS-PROT. REM-TrEMBL entries have no accession
    numbers. This section is organized in five subsections:

       1) Immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors (Immuno.dat)
          Most REM-TrEMBL entries are  immunoglobulins and  T-cell receptors. We
          stopped entering immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors into SWISS-PROT,
          because we only want to keep  the  germ line gene derived translations
          of these proteins in SWISS-PROT and not all known somatic recombinated
          variations of  these proteins.  We would like to  create a specialized
          database  dealing  with  these  sequences  as a further  supplement to
          SWISS-PROT  and  keep  only a  representative  cross-section of  these
          proteins in SWISS-PROT.

       2) Synthetic sequences (Synth.dat)
          Another category of data, which will not be included in SWISS-PROT are
          synthetic sequences.  Again, we do not want to  leave these entries in
          TrEMBL. Ideally one should build a specialized database for artificial
          sequences as a further supplement to SWISS-PROT.

       3) Patent application sequences (Patent.dat)
          A third  subsection consists of  coding sequences captured from patent
          applications.  A thorough  survey of  these  entries  have shown  that
          apart from a rather small minority  (which in  most cases have already
          been integrated in SWISS-PROT), most of these sequences contain either
          erroneous data or concern artificially generated sequences outside the
          scope of SWISS-PROT.

       4) Small fragments (Smalls.dat)
          Another  subsection  consists of fragments  with less than eight amino
          acids.

       5) CDS not coding for real proteins (Pseudo.dat)
          The last subsection consists of  CDS translations where we have strong
          evidence to believe that these CDS are not coding for real proteins.


                    4. Format Differences Between SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL

    The format and conventions used by TrEMBL follow as closely as possible
    that of SWISS-PROT. Hence, it is not necessary to produce an additional
    user manual and extensive release notes for TrEMBL. The information given
    in the SWISS-PROT release notes and user manual are in general valid for
    TrEMBL. The differences are mentioned below.

    The general structure of an entry is identical in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL.
    The data class used in TrEMBL (in the ID line) is always 'PRELIMINARY',
    whereas in SWISS-PROT it is always 'STANDARD'.

    Differences in line types present in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL:

    The ID line (IDentification):

    The entry name used in SP-TrEMBL is the same as the Accession Number of the
    entry. The entry name used in REM-TrEMBL is the protein_id tagged to the
    corresponding CDS in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. 'protein_id'
    stands for the "Protein IDentification" number. It is a number that you
    will find in the feature table of the EMBL nucleotide sequence entries
    in a qualifier called "/protein_id" which is tagged to every CDS.

    Example:

    FT   CDS             339..1514
    FT                   /codon_start=1
    FT                   /db_xref="PID:g1256015"
    FT                   /product="dystrobrevin-epsilon"
    FT                   /protein_id="AAC50431.1"


    The DT line (DaTe)

    The format of the DT lines that serve to indicate when an entry was
    created and updated are identical to that defined in SWISS-PROT; but the
    DT lines in TrEMBL are referring to the TrEMBL release. The difference is
    shown in the example below.

        DT lines in a SWISS-PROT entry:

        DT   01-JAN-1988 (Rel. 06, Created)
        DT   01-JUL-1989 (Rel. 11, Last sequence update)
        DT   01-AUG-1992 (Rel. 23, Last annotation update)

        DT lines in a TrEMBL entry:

        DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Created)
        DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Last sequence update)
        DT   01-FEB-1997 (TrEMBLrel. 02, Last annotation update)

                    5. Weekly updates of TrEMBL and non-redundant data sets

    Weekly cumulative updates of TrEMBL are available by anonymous FTP and
    from the EBI SRS server.

    We also produce every week a complete non-redundant protein sequence
    collection by providing three compressed files (these are in the directory
    /pub/databases/sp_tr_nrdb on the EBI FTP server and in databases/sp_tr_nrdb
    on the ExPASy server): sprot.dat.Z, trembl.dat.Z and trembl_new.dat.Z.
    This set of non-redundant files is especially important for two types of
    users:
    (i) Managers of similarity search services. They can now provide what is
    currently the most comprehensive and non-redundant data set of protein
    sequences.
    (ii) Anybody wanting to update their full copy of SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL to
    their own schedule without having to wait for full releases of SWISS-PROT
    or of TrEMBL.

                    6. Access/Data Distribution

    FTP server:     ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl
    SRS server:     http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/

    TrEMBL is also available on the SWISS-PROT CD-ROM.
    SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL is searchable on the following servers at the EBI:
    FASTA3  (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/fasta3/)
    BLAST2  (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/blast2/)
    Bic_sw  (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/bic_sw/)
    Scanps  (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/scanps/)
    SSearch (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/ssearch3/)

      7. Description of changes made to TrEMBL since release 9.

    7.1  Extension of the accession number system.

    As all possible numbers with the 'O' series have been used, a new system of
    accession numbers has been introduced in TrEMBL release 10. This system is
    based on the following format:

        1        2       3          4            5            6
        [O,P,Q]  [0-9]  [A-Z, 0-9]  [A-Z, 0-9]   [A-Z, 0-9]   [0-9]

    What the above means is that we will keep a six-character code, but that
    in positions 3, 4 and 5 of this code a letter or a number can be present.
    We allow only numbers in positions 2 and 6.

    Examples: Q9ZXM8, Q9ZNQ2, Q9YGB9, Q9YH55


    7.2  New Protein Sequence Identifier in the cross-references to the EMBL
    nucleotide sequence database.

    The new protein sequences identifiers introduced in the EMBL nucleotide
    sequence database release 58 are now present in all cross-references
    to the EMBL nucleotide sequence database and replace the previous PIDs.

    The new protein sequence identifier consists of a stable ID portion
    (3+5 format with 3 position letters and 5 numbers) plus a version number
    after a decimal point.

    Example:

    DR   EMBL; L37685; AAC41668.1; -.


    7.3  Conversion of TrEMBL to mixed cases.

    In this release we have converted to mixed cases the following line
    types:

     DT, OS, OG, OC, RL and KW

    This conversion is described in detail in section 3.1 of the release notes
    of SWISS-PROT release 37.0.


    7.4. RL lines.

    The format for RL lines for submissions to DNA databases has changed.

    Example: in release 9 the format was:

    RL   SUBMITTED (APR-1996) TO EMBL/GENBANK/DDBJ DATA BANKS.

    In release 10 it is :

    RL   Submitted (APR-1996) to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases.
