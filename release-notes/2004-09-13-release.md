## Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). For the feature key [MOD_RES](https://www.uniprot.org/manual/mod_res), the new introduced controlled vocabularies for PTMs are:

- Flavin binding: All entries with annotated flavin-binding sites have the keyword [Flavoprotein](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0285).

       FMN phosphoryl serine (Keyword: FMN)
       FMN phosphoryl threonine (Keyword: FMN)
       O-8alpha-FAD tyrosine (Keyword: FAD)
       S-4a-FMN cysteine (Keyword: FMN)
       S-6-FMN cysteine (Keyword: FMN)
       S-8alpha-FAD cysteine (Keyword: FAD)
       Tele-8alpha-FAD histidine (Keyword: FAD)
       Tele-8alpha-FMN histidine (Keyword: FMN)

- Hydroxylation: All entries with annotated hydroxylation sites have the keyword [Hydroxylation](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0379).

       4,5-dihydroxylysine
       3,4-dihydroxyproline

- Other new controlled vocabularies for PTMs that are annotated with the feature key MOD_RES:

       O-(sn-1-glycerophosphoryl)serine
