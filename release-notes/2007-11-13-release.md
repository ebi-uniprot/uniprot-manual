## Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, a "giant" virus in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

[Mimivirus](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/212035) (for mimicking microbe) is a new viral genus containing a single identified species, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV), discovered by Didier Raoult's lab in 1992 within the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga while working on Legionellosis. The virion has a non-enveloped, icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 400 nm and protein filaments projecting from its surface. The capsid contains the internal core surrounded by an internal lipid layer. Its linear, [double- stranded DNA genome](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15486256) is roughly 1.2 million bp in length, the largest viral genome known so far. Its replication cycle, genome and capsid structure place it into the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses ([NCLDVs](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16494962)), which include amongst others the poxviruses and iridoviruses.

This virus is amazing in many ways. It is the largest virus ever isolated, with a genome size and complexity comparable to that of a small bacterium. A thorough bioinformatics analysis carried out by the group of Jean-Michel Claverie uncovered 909 potential protein-coding genes. Some of these proteins belong to families that are shared with all or some NCLDVs, many have eukaryotic counterparts and there are quite a number of [ORFans](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16971431) (no sequence similarity to proteins from other genomes). It was a surprise to find an appreciable number of genes coding for proteins involved in metabolism, DNA repair pathways and, most surprising, genes encoding a partially functional protein translation apparatus. Mimivirus does indeed encode [four aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855524) ([ArgRS](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q5UQ59), [CysRS](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q5UP36), [MetRS](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q5UR82), [TyrRS](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q5UPJ7)), as well as various translation initiation, elongation and termination factors. It is very intriguing to find, in a virus, genes corresponding to central components of the protein translation machinery, a biochemical process widely thought to be an exclusive signature of cellular organisms.

The discovery of this amazing virus has lead to the concept of ["giant" virus](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469402) and implies that there is an overlap in terms of particle dimension, genome size, and genetic complexity between the viral and cellular organism worlds.

A special effort has been made in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database to provide the complete, fully annotated mimivirus proteome. We have also integrated all proteomics and structural information that has been made available by the groups of Jean-Michel Claverie and Chantal Abergel.

# UniProtKB News

## Format change in the ptmlist.txt document file

The ptmlist.txt document, which is available by [ftp](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/docs/ptmlist.txt) and on the [Web site](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist), describes the post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries in the sequence annotation section (Features) (FT lines in the flat file) in the subsections "Cross-link" (CROSSLNK key in the flat file), "Lipidation" (LIPID key in the flat file) and "Modified residue" (MOD_RES key in the flat file). The document was in a format that was suitable for computer applications (e.g. ExPASy's proteomics tools), but which was not very human readable. The new file format should improve this.

Previous format:

## Changes concerning cross-references to PDB

We added an additional field to the cross-reference (DR line in the flat file) to the PDB database to show the resolution of structures that were determined by X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.

For the chain names we use now the [remediated data](http://remediation.wwpdb.org/) from [wwPDB](http://www.wwpdb.org/), therefore the chain names have changed for some entries.

Previous format:

    DR   PDB; ENTRY_NAME; METHOD; CHAIN.

New format:

    DR   PDB; ENTRY_NAME; METHOD; RESOLUTION; CHAIN.

Examples:

[Q20728](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q20728) :

    DR   PDB; 1LPL; X-ray; 1.77 A; A=135-229.

[Q5HEB7](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q5HEB7) :

    DR   PDB; 2I8C; X-ray; 2.46 A; A/B=1-356.

A dash indicates that we found no information about the resolution or that the field is not applicable (for NMR structures and theoretical models).

Examples:

[P02768](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P02768) :

    DR   PDB; 2ESG; X-ray; -; C=25-609.

[P12872](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P12872) :

    DR   PDB; 1LBJ; NMR; -; A=26-47.

[P0AC41](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0AC41) :

    DR   PDB; 2AD0; Model; -; A=1-588.

## Cross-references to CleanEx

Cross-references have been added to the [CleanEx database of gene expression profiles](http://www.cleanex.isb-sib.ch/). CleanEx is a database which provides access to public gene expression data via unique approved gene symbols and which represents heterogeneous expression data produced by different technologies in a way that facilitates joint analysis and cross-dataset comparison.

The CleanEx database is available at <http://www.cleanex.isb-sib.ch/>.

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 39%" /><col style="width: 60%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>CleanEx</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Combination of a species code and a gene identifier.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Examples</td><td><pre><code>O08788:
DR   CleanEx; MM_DCTN1; -.

P78358:
DR CleanEx; HS_CTAG1A; -.
DR CleanEx; HS_CTAG1B; -.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Changes concerning keywords (KW line)

Modified keyword:

- Phosphorylation -&gt; [Phosphoprotein](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0597)
