## SPIN - the new web tool for sequence submission to Swiss-Prot

A new web-based tool, [SPIN](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Submissions/spin/), is available for submitting directly sequenced protein sequences and their biological annotations to the Swiss-Prot Protein Knowledgebase. SPIN guides you through a sequence of WWW forms allowing interactive submission. The information required to create a database entry will be collected during this process.

Annotation updates for existing Swiss-Prot entries are highly appreciated and should be submitted via the "Submit Update" button at the top of any entry \[ example \]. User update requests are treated with a high priority by our annotators.
