Prokaryotes do it too:

CRISPR, an

RNA -based adaptive immune system in UniProt

Like all other cellular organisms, bacteria and archaea are constantly bombarded by viruses, and unlike eukaryotes, many are also susceptible to infective plasmids. While we have known about defenses such as restriction-modification systems, blockage of absorption and/or

DNA injection and abortive infection for some time, new ways in which bacteria and archaea defend themselves against these infective agents have been found more recently. One of these is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences.

CRISPR is an

RNA -based adaptive immune system, which degrades invading genetic material. The system is mechanistically different from eukaryotic

RNA interference (RNAi) and the proteins involved in prokaryotes are not homologous to those in eukaryotes ( [review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22337052) ).

CRISPRs are repetitive loci on the genome consisting of unique sequences 20-50 bases long (the spacer sequences) interspaced with repeated sequences of about the same length. Examination of the spacer sequences has shown that some are identical to viral and plasmid sequences; they are thought to serve as a “memory” of a previous infection. Bacteria and archaea can have from 0 to 18

CRISPR loci, with between 2 and 249 repeat-spacer units. While many pathogens have

CRISPR loci, [obligate parasites do not](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21552286). The

CRISPR loci are transcribed and processed to give short

CRISPR -derived

RNA (crRNA) [complementary to a previously-encountered infective agent](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703739). It is this crRNA that is at the heart of adaptive prokaryotic immunity.

There are a large number of proteins associated with

CRISPR loci, the operon-encoded

CRISPR -associated or Cas proteins. The Cas proteins present in each locus have allowed the definition of

3 major

CRISPR -Cas systems with further division into a number of subtypes. The number of subtypes will probably continue to increase as more prokaryotic genomes are fully sequenced. Many of these proteins are predicted to be nucleases, helicases and/or

RNA binding proteins as is to be expected given the function of

CRISPR .

There are 3 stages in

CRISPR -Cas mediated immunity:

Stage 1, adaptation or acquisition, is the least well characterized.

A short piece of

DNA homologous to an invading agent is integrated into the 5’ end of the

CRISPR loci. This requires the [metal-dependent Cas1 endoribonuclease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21219465,19427858,19523907), the only Cas protein found in all organisms with

CRISPR loci, although almost all organisms also encode Cas2, another metal-dependent endoribonuclease which is also [thought to be involved in adaptation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21255106) .

Stage 2, expression or crRNA biogenesis, requires transcription and processing of the

CRISPR loci to produce the crRNA. Type

I CRISPR systems use one of the [related, metal-independent Cas6, Cas6e or Cas6f endoribonucleases to process the precursor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703739,20829488,19141480), while

type

III systems use endogenous RNase

III to generate the crRNA. It is not yet known which protein produces crRNA in type II systems.

Stage 3, interference, is the [destruction of the target (be it virus or plasmid) and is performed by a complex of crRNA and proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21938068,22621933,22521690,21507944,21536913). While it is generally thought

to recognize invading

DNA, the

type

III -B

CRISPR system of Pyrococcus furiosis cleaves target

RNA .

While

CRISPR -Cas systems can now be assumed to be involved in adaptive immunity, there are tantalizing hints that they may perform other functions as well. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa

UCBPP -PA14, the type

I CRISPR system does not confer resistance to phages

DMS3 or

MP22, but is required for

DMS3 -dependent inhibition of biofilm formation and possibly motility, while in Myxococcus xanthus, a

CRISPR system is [involved in the regulation of fruiting body development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17369305) .

We have recently annotated and updated characterized Cas proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, although the field moves so quickly that it is impossible to be fully up-to-date with all the latest research. All manually annotated

CRISPR -associated protein entries can be retrieved from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot using the query term [‘CRISPR’ in ‘Protein name’](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=name:CRISPR) .
