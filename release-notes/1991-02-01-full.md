       1.1  Evolution

       Release 17.0  of SWISS-PROT  contains 20024 sequence entries, comprising
       6'524'504 amino  acids abstracted from 19591 references. This represents
       an increase of 9% over release 16. The recent growth of the data bank is
       summarized below:

       1.2  Source of data

       Release 17.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data from release
       26.0 of  the PIR (Protein Identification Resource) protein data bank, as
       well as translation of nucleotide sequence data from release 25.0 of the
       EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library.

       As an  indication to  the source  of the sequence data in the SWISS-PROT
       data bank  we list  here the  statistics  concerning  the  DR  (Databank
       Reference) pointer lines:

       Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):           3752
       Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):          3713
       Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es): 12112
       Entries with no pointers lines:                           447




          2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE RELEASE 16


       2.1  Sequences and annotations

       About 1700 sequences have been added since release 16, the sequence data
       of 312  existing entries  has been  updated and  the annotations of 3750
       entries have  been revised.  In particular we have used reviews articles
       to update  the annotations  of  the  following  groups  or  families  of
       proteins:

       -  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
       -  Aconitase
       -  Alpha-2 macroglobulin family
       -  ATP synthase a subunit
       -  Catalases
       -  Chalcone resveratrol synthases
       -  Citrate synthase
       -  Dihydroorotase
       -  DNA polymerase family A
       -  Eukaryotic cobalamin-binding proteins
       -  Fatty acid desaturases
       -  Fungal  Zn(2)-Cys(6)   binuclear   cluster   domain   transcriptional
          activators
       -  Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase
       -  Glutamine amidotransferases class-I
       -  Glutamine amidotransferases class-II
       -  Gonadotropin-releasing hormones
       -  Guanylate cyclases
       -  LIM-1 domain proteins
       -  Myotoxins
       -  Nucleoside diphosphate kinases
       -  Pathogenesis-related proteins BetvI family
       -  Peroxidases
       -  Polyprenyl synthetases
       -  Ribosomal proteins
       -  Rotamases (cyclophilin and FKBP)
       -  Small cytokines (PF4/IL-8 and MCAF/MIP-1 subfamilies)
       -  Sodium symporters
       -  Thiol-activated cytolysins


       2.2 Status of cross-references to PIR

       Older releases of SWISS-PROT contained cross-references to entries which
       were present  only in  the annotated  section of PIR (currently known as
       PIR1); we  started adding cross-references to entries in the unannotated
       sections of PIR (known as PIR2 and PIR3).



                                3. FORTHCOMING CHANGES

       3.1  New line-types: RC and RP

       We plan  to implement the following change in release 19; the current RN
       line will  be replaced  by three  line types:  a modified  RN (Reference
       Number) line  type containing  just  the  reference  number,  a  new  RC
       (Reference Comment)  line  type  containing  comments  relevant  to  the
       reference (strain, tissue, etc.), and a new RP (Reference Position) line
       type containing  the extent of the sequencing carried out by the authors
       of the  reference. Three  examples of  the usage  of these new lines are
       given below.

          RN   [1]
          RC   STRAIN=K12;
          RP   SEQUENCE FROM N.A., AND SEQUENCE OF 1-23.

          RN   [1]
          RC   STRAIN=BALB/C; TISSUE=BRAIN;
          RP   SEQUENCE OF 24-56 AND 67-89.

          RN   [2]
          RC   X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY=1.8 ANGSTROMS;


       Each reference  block will continue to have exactly one RN line. As many
       RC lines  as are  needed to display the reference's comment will appear.
       If a  reference has no comment then the RC line will not appear. As many
       RP lines  as are  needed to display the extent of sequencing carried out
       by the  authors of  the reference.  If  a  reference  does  not  pertain
       directly to sequencing data then the RP line will not appear.

       3.2  New line-types: CA and CF

       As we announced in the last two release notes, starting with release 18,
       the enzyme entries in SWISS-PROT will have two new line-types:

          CA   Description_of_catalytic_activity.
          CF   Description_of_cofactor.

       These lines  will be  automatically generated  at each release of SWISS-
       PROT from  the information  stored in  the ENZYME  data bank.  They will
       replace the  'CATALYTIC ACTIVITY`  and 'COFACTORS`  comment  lines  (CC)
       topics. Example:

          CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-ASPARTATE + 2-OXOGLUTARATE =
                   OXALOACETATE + L-GLUTAMATE.
          CC   -!- COFACTOR: PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE.

       will be changed to:

          CA   L-ASPARTATE + 2-OXOGLUTARATE = OXALOACETATE + L-GLUTAMATE.
          CF   PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE.



       3.3  Change in the OS line

       As we announced in the last two release notes, starting with release 18,
       we will invert the order of the information in the OS line. Currently we
       have 'English  common name  (Latin name)`, we will switch to 'Latin name
       (English common name)`. Example:

          OS   HUMAN (HOMO SAPIENS).

       will be changed to:

          OS   HOMO SAPIENS (HUMAN).


                                4. ENZYME AND PROSITE

       4.1  The ENZYME data bank

       Release 4.0 of the ENZYME data bank is distributed along with release 17
       of SWISS-PROT.  ENZYME release 4.0 contains information relative to 3072
       enzymes. The  data bank  is complete  and up  to date.  Until new enzyme
       nomenclature data  is published  we only  plan to  update the SWISS-PROT
       pointers at  each release  of the  protein sequence  data bank,  correct
       eventual errors,  and complete  the information  concerning synonyms and
       cofactors using the literature.

       4.2  The PROSITE data bank

       Release 6.1  of the  PROSITE data bank is distributed along with release
       17 of  SWISS-PROT. PROSITE  release 6.1  does not really represent a new
       release; the  only changes  between release 6.0 and 6.1 are  updating of
       the pointers  to the  SWISS-PROT entries  whose name  have been modified
       between release  16 and  17. The  next release  of PROSITE (7.0) will be
       distributed with release 18.0 of SWISS-PROT.


                                5. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

       We welcome  feedback from our users. We would especially appreciate that
       you notify  us if  you find  that sequences  belonging to  your field of
       expertise are  missing from  the data  bank. We  also would  like to  be
       notified about annotations to be updated, as for example if the function
       of a protein has been clarified or if new post-translational information
       has become available.
