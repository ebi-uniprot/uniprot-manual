## Transient pleasures of the mind

Symmetry and round objects, including round numbers, easily fascinate the human mind. Thus, UniProtKB is happy to announce that we have a double set of round numbers to celebrate: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot now contains over 50'000 cross-references to PDB and over [5'000 mammalian entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=database:pdb+AND+taxonomy:mammalia+AND+reviewed:yes) with experimental 3D-structures.

It is deeply satisfactory to see the 3D-structure of a protein. 3D-structures show the interactions between proteins and other macromolecules, and between proteins and small ligands, such as metal ions, substrates and inhibitors. Determining the 3D-structure is an important step for elucidating the mode of action of a well-characterized protein, and it provides a starting point for the classification of an uncharacterized protein and the prediction of its physiological role.

UniProtKB provides access to protein 3D-structures via cross-references to PDB (see for example [P00734](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00734#section_x-ref) ). The number of structures is constantly increasing, and quite frequently several structures have been determined for a given protein. Thus, the 50'000 cross-references to PDB in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot correspond to more than [12'700 individual entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:yes). Over 5'000 of these (about 40%) are from mammalian model organisms, including close to [3'300 human entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:yes+AND+taxonomy_id:9606), while bacteria and archaea account for over [4'500](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=%28database%3Apdb+AND+reviewed%3Ayes%29+AND+%28taxonomy%3AArchaea+OR+taxonomy%3A%22Bacteria+%5B2%5D%22%29) of the entries with links to PDB. Escherichica coli strain K12 is currently the best studied organism at the structural level, with [1035](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:yes+AND+taxonomy:K12) out of its [4'339 proteins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=taxonomy%3A83333+AND+keyword%3A%22complete+proteome%22) (almost 25%) having at least one link to a PDB entry. Close to 6'000 additional links to PDB are in UniProtKB/TrEMBL, corresponding to another [3'500 entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:no) .

Thanks to the efforts of individual laboratories and structural proteomics groups, the number of experimental 3D-structures is rapidly increasing, and so the symmetrical roundness of the present numbers is a very transient phenomenon. Soon for every new protein there may be a family member with an experimental 3D-structure, even for membrane proteins. That is definitely something to look forward to.

## Cross-references to AGRICOLA

In the flat file, the RX (Reference cross-reference) line is an optional line which is used to indicate cross-references to bibliographic databases. We have introduced cross-references to [AGRICOLA](http://agricola.nal.usda.gov), the National Agricultural Library's catalog of citations to agricultural literature. The valid bibliographic database names and their associated identifiers are now:

| Name         | Identifier                                 |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| MEDLINE      | Eight-digit MEDLINE Unique Identifier (UI) |
| PubMed       | PubMed Unique Identifier (PMID)            |
| DOI          | Digital Object Identifier (DOI)            |
| **AGRICOLA** | AGRICOLA Unique Identifier                 |

Example:

    Q01901:
         RX   AGRICOLA=IND20450567;
