## Levering the DNA

During the process of genetic recombination, two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules are separated into four strands, enabling exchange of segments of genetic information. These amazing four-stranded branched DNA structures are called [Holliday junctions (HJs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holliday_junction#/media/File:Holliday_junction_coloured.png). HJs are also formed during DNA double-strand break repair and replication fork rescue, and their resolution is essential for all cellular life forms. The mobile HJ DNA heteroduplexes undergo ATP-dependent branch migration; think of them as a cruciform structure that moves along DNA. The bacterial RuvABC proteins, named after their property to confer cellular resistance to UV light, have been known for years to be instrumental in one of the pathways involved in the resolution of HJs. RuvC is a Holliday junction resolvase, an endonuclease, that acts at specific sequences. At these sites, RuvC makes single-stranded nicks across the cruciform at symmetrical sites, allowing resolution of the 4-branch DNA into 2 double-stranded DNA strands. To find the appropriate cleavage site, the HJ junction undergoes branch migration and RuvAB is essential for the migration.

[Recent work by the group of Thomas Marlovits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36002576/) has shed new light on the mechanism by which branch migration occurs. They used time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy to solve distinct intermediates in the assembly and processing of the bacterial HJ. A pair of RuvA homotetramers sandwich and slightly flatten the center of the double-stranded cruciform HJ DNA, with the (potential) HJ resolution site in the middle of the complex. RuvB assembles into an asymmetric hexameric ring with a central pore surrounding DNA. Two RuvB homohexamers assemble on opposite strands of dsDNA as it exits the RuvA-HJ core. The C-terminal domain of 2 RuvA subunits binds 2 adjacent RuvB subunits. RuvB is a ring-shaped AAA+ ATPase motor and coordinated movements among the 4 DNA-disengaged subunits (called the converter) stimulate ATP hydrolysis, nucleotide exchange and ultimately branch migration by these subunits. The converter subunits are trapped on the DNA by their contact with RuvA, thus the energy released during ATP hydrolysis is converted into a lever motion, where RuvA anchors RuvB which then lifts and pulls 2 nucleotides of DNA through the center of the homohexamer. At the same time the complex rotates with the DNA, 60&#176; at a time. When one ATP cycle is over the RuvA subunits disengage from RuvB and bind to the next subunits of the RuvB hexamer; the cycle recommences. Both RuvB homohexamers pull DNA, allowing a continual search for the RuvC recognition sequence. How RuvC scans the DNA is unknown, although it is assumed it displaces one of the RuvA tetramers to resolve the HJ DNA.

The data suggest that the majority of ring-shaped AAA+ motors may function as molecular levers, converting protein conformational changes into lift activity of their central pores, which subsequently facilitates substrate (in this case DNA) translocation. Elucidation of this mechanism will allow other motors to be re-examined and may lead to the design of compounds that target specific states of the motor.

## Changes in prokaryotic taxonomy

In release 2023_02, prokaryotic taxonomy will be changed in accordance with alterations that have occurred in the [NCBI taxonomy database](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2022/11/14/prokaryotic-phylum-name-changes/). These changes are due to inclusion of the rank [phylum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34161220/) in the International Code of Nomenclature for Prokaryotes ([INCP](https://www.the-icsp.org/index.php/code-of-nomenclatur)), and are based on a recommendation made by [Oren and Garrity, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34694987/). Examples of the changes include ___Firmicutes___ to ___Bacillota___, ___Crenarchaeota___ to ___Thermoproteota___, and ___Proteobacteria___ to ___Pseudomonadota___. A full list of the phylum name changes is [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/Major_taxonomic_updates_2023.txt).
