## UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot major release (52.0)

UniProt Knowledgebase release 10.0 includes Swiss-Prot release 52.0 and TrEMBL release 35.0.

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot release 52.0 of March 6, 2007 contains 260'175 sequence entries, comprising 95'002'661 amino acids abstracted from 152'564 references. 18'986 sequences have been added since release 51.0: this represents an increase of 7.3%. In addition, the annotations of 190'910 entries have been revised.

Many improvements were carried out in the last 4 months:

-   We have reintroduced the initiator methionine: the UniProtKB sequence data now always corresponds to the precursor form of a protein, i.e. before post-translational modifications such as cleavage of the signal peptide or other events (except of course when the sequence data are derived from direct protein sequencing).
-   We have extended the UniProtKB accession number format: we have extended the existing accession number format by allowing the first character to be any of the 26 letters (instead of only O, P and Q).
-   We have added cross-references to 7 new databases and introduced a new molecule type for the EMBL cross-references (Viral\_cRNA)

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (flat file version) turned 1 [Gigabyte (GB)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) long on this major release ! For comparison, the human genome contains 0.791175 GB of data (the 3.1647 x 10^9 base pairs represented as 2-bits)

## Format change in the dbxref.txt document file

The [dbxref.txt](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/dbxref) file lists the names and abbreviations and URLs of all databases cross-referenced in the UniProt Knowledgebase. We have added a new optional field, " **Ref** ". This field contains the database reference in the following format:

    Ref   : Journal_abbrev Volume:First_page-Last_page(YYYY); [PubMed=Pubmed_identifier; ][DOI=Digital_object_identifier;]

Example:

         Abbrev: PROSITE
         Name  : PROSITE; a protein domain and family database
         Ref   : Nucleic Acids Res. 34:D227-D230(2006); PubMed=16381852; DOI=10.1093/nar/gkj063;
         LinkTp: Explicit
         Server: http://www.expasy.org/prosite/
         Db_URL: www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/get-prosite-raw.pl?%s
         Cat   : Family and domain databases
