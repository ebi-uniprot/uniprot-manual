## The 'dark' side of male contraception

In 2021, [Ma et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34155512/) studied a Pakistani family in which 4 brothers out of 6 were infertile and presented with asthenozoospermia, a condition where a significant proportion of sperm demonstrates poor motility. The culprit was identified as a genetic variant disrupting STK33, a gene encoding a serine/threonine-protein kinase. STK33 variants were found later on in other [patients with nonobstructive azoospermia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37146716/). [STK33 knockout mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29155043/) are also sterile and show severely malformed and immotile spermatozoa with disordered structural tail elements.

STK33 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that belongs to the [group of 'dark' kinases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33079988/), i.e. those that are understudied and thus poorly understood. STK33 is expressed in testis. Its [expression is initiated during meiosis I in primary spermatocytes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29155043/) during the pachytene period and is maintained during spermatogenesis It has been shown to [phosphorylate in vitro fibrous sheath proteins AKAP3 and AKAP4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37146716/), and could thereby promote sperm flagella assembly during spermatogenesis.

STK33 looks like a perfect target for compounds that could control male fertility. This has been investigated by [Ku et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38781365/). To do so, they used DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs), a high throughput technology. In this method, each chemical compound to be tested is tagged with a unique DNA sequence. The target, here STK33, is immobilized and the compounds in the mixture allowed to bind. Non-binders are removed by washing steps, and binders can be identified by virtue of their DNA code. This approach allowed the screening of a multibillion-compound collection (we really mean _billions_ here). The best binders were confirmed and characterized with other assays. Several high affinity STK33 binders were identified. The ones selected had only low inhibitory activity towards other kinases and were relatively stable. One of them, CDD-2211 was further investigated by [X-ray crystallography](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8VF6) in complex with its STK33 target to understand more precisely how they interacted and hence to improve selectivity.

Another highly selective compound, CDD-2807, was tested in mice by intraperitoneal injection at low doses. After 21 days of treatment, the males were sterile. They showed no sign of toxicity. The testis size was unchanged, and the compound was undetectable in the brain. After the treatment was stopped, the mice regained fertility after about 3 weeks.

Currently the burden of family planning falls predominantly on women. What if each of us could control his/her own fertility? That would obviously be optimal. Hormone-based approaches for male contraception are being investigated in clinical trials, but none have been approved so far, and only few non-hormonal compounds have been developed. In this context, the identification of new targets and new selective compounds is extremely valuable.

[UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot STK33 entries](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=id%3AQ9BYT3+OR+id%3AQ924X7) have been updated with these new findings and are publicly available as of this release.
