## 1'500 cited journals

It is interesting to note that information relevant to the scope of Swiss-Prot is found in a continuously increasing number of [scientific journals](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/jourlist). Currently Swiss-Prot cites 1'500 different journals. Only 5 years ago, this number was slightly less than 1'000. Out of those 1'500 journals, 157 are either no longer published or have changed their names. It is also noteworthy that about 50% of these 1'500 journals are only cited less than four times in the knowledgebase. At the other extreme, only 106 journals are cited more than 100 times.
