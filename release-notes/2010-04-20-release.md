## Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: To be or not to be… integrated in UniProtKB

It has been known for [over 30 years](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/388431) that, in yeast, nonsense mutations reduce mRNA levels and that the strength of the reduction depends on the position of the nonsense codon within the locus. This observation, followed by many others in a great variety of eukaryotic organisms, led to the concept of ‘Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay’ (NMD), ‘a surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), thereby preventing the production of faulty proteins’. The key question was what Mother Nature considers a ’ _premature_ ’ stop. For mammals, a rule was established stating that ’if a termination codon is more than about 50 nucleotides upstream of the final exon, it is a

PTC and the mRNA that harbors it will be degraded’ (see [Nagy and Maquat, 1998](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9644970) ). Although we know today that

NMD is a much more sophisticated mechanism than previously anticipated (see [reviews](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19859661,19359157,19162024,18524595) ), the ‘50 nucleotide rule’ is still used to predict potential

NMD targets and, on this basis, some databases deleted them from their collections. Since many PTCs are generated by alternative splicing (at least [one third](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12502788) of the human alternatively spliced mRNAs contain PTCs), several alternatively spliced isoforms have disappeared from databases, victims of the ‘50 nucleotide rule’.

Eukaryotic cells detect

PTC during the first round of translation undergone by mRNAs freshly exported from the nucleus. During this ‘pioneer’ round of translation, if the ribosome terminates at a termination codon (TC) in the vicinity of the poly(A) tail,

PABPC1 – a poly(A)-binding protein – sends a signal which promotes proper termination of translation. This results in efficient reinitiation of the ribosome at the 5’ end of the mRNA, and the production of a stable mRNP. If the ribosome terminates at a TC that is too far away from the poly(A) tail for it to receive the

PABPC1 – mediated translation-termination-promoting signal, the

UPF1 protein binds to the stalled ribosome instead, thereby marking this TC as premature. Subsequently, a

PTC -specific protein complex forms around

UPF1, promoting

UPF1 phosphorylation and committing the mRNA to rapid degradation.

It is thought that the physical distance, rather than the number of nucleotides, between a TC and the poly(A) tail is a crucial determinant in defining a TC as premature ( [Eberle et al., 2008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18447580) ). This distance depends on the 3D structure of the mRNA 3’

UTR. This structure can be modified by altering (1) intramolecular base pairing, (2) interaction of the mRNA with

RNA -binding proteins and (3) interactions between the involved proteins through post-translational modifications (PTMs). In other words, it can be regulated in a tissue-specific manner, during development, and by environmental cues.

In higher eukaryotes, an additional level of complexity exists which links

PTC detection and mRNA splicing. During pre-mRNA processing, the spliceosome removes intron sequences and a set of proteins called the exon-junction complex (EJC) is deposited 20-24 nucleotides upstream of the sites of intron removal. EJCs located within the

ORF are removed from the mRNA by elongating ribosomes, and only EJCs located downstream of the TC will still be present when the first ribosome terminates. In organisms producing a large number of

PTC -containing mRNAs by extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing, such as humans, the

EJC may have evolved to facilitate efficient recognition and degradation of these transcripts. An

EJC downstream of a TC functions as an

NMD enhancer by shortening the time window between

UPF1 binding and its phosphorylation, hence promoting mRNA degradation.

NMD rarely downregulates the expression of a transcript completely. More commonly, 10-30% of the

PTC -containing transcripts survive and may allow the production of physiologically relevant levels of protein products ( [Neu-Yilik et al., 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15059251) ). This is why in UniProtKB, we favour a conservative approach when dealing with protein isoforms predicted to be encoded by an

NMD target mRNA. We do not delete them from the database, but rather tag them with the comment: ‘May be produced at very low levels due to a premature stop codon in the mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.’ For instance, in entry

Q9HB09 (human Bcl-2-like protein 12), [2 isoforms](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9HB09#section_alternative) are described, one of which has been predicted to be an

NMD target by [Hillman et al., 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14759258) (see also the [‘References’](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9HB09#section_ref) section of the entry). In some cases, despite the presence of a

PTC in the encoding mRNA, the isoform produced seems to be the predominant form, at least in some tissues (see human Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 [isoform 1E](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9UBS5#section_alternative) in entry

Q9UBS5 ).

Currently in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, over [300 protein entries](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=%22nonsense+mediated+mrna+decay%22+AND+reviewed:true+NOT+keyword:KW-0866) describe isoforms that could be produced at low levels due to

NMD. [228 proteins](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=keyword:KW-0866) from different species are directly involved in the

NMD process itself and can be retrieved from UniProtKB with the keyword [‘Nonsense mediated mRNA decay’](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0866) .
