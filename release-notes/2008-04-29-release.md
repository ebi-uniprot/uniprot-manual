## 6 million entries in UniProtKB

Once upon a long, long time... This is how all fairy tales start, but was it really so long ago? No, it was December 2003 - just 4 and a half years ago, but it seems like ages - that UniProtKB was born. It was a beautiful baby, 1,220,020 entries fat and well supported by its 2 legs: the large TrEMBL and the small but knowledgeable Swiss-Prot. And the baby put on weight: on average 1,500 protein sequence entries per day in 2004 and during the first half of 2005. The more you have, the more you want, and from the middle of 2005 up to beginning of 2007, UniProtKB was integrating about 3,500 new entries per day. And it hasn't stopped since: currently we are integrating approximately 5,000 entries per day and this number keeps growing. As a result, we are happy to announce that UniProtKB has reached the significant milestone of 6,074,524 entries. Note that this tremendous growth is not due to the submission of environmental samples that are stored in another UniProt database: UniMES.

May we all live happily ever after and extract knowledge from this flood of data!

## Cross-references to NMPDR

Cross-references have been added to the [National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource](http://www.nmpdr.org/). NMPDR is a National Institute of Allergy and Infections Disease (NIAID)-funded Bioinformatics Resource Center that supports research in selected Category B pathogens. NMPDR contains the complete genomes of approximately 50 strains of pathogenic bacteria as well as &gt;400 other genomes that provide a broad context for comparative analysis across the three phylogenetic domains. NMPDR integrates complete, public genomes with expertly curated biological subsystems to provide the most consistent genome annotations. Subsystems are sets of functional roles related by a biologically meaningful organizing principle, which are built over large collections of genomes; they provide researchers with consistent functional assignments in a biologically structured context.

The National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource is available at <http://www.nmpdr.org/> .
