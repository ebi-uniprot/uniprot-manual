## Major update of C.elegans entries

We have recently finished a major update of Caenorhabditis elegans entries in Swiss-Prot. The following tasks were carried out:

- Update and "homogeneization" of all references to the genome project and sequence revisions;
- Addition of cross-references to WormBase;
- Re-annotation of many existing entries using literature references;
- Manual annotation of about one hundred new entries.
