## Complete proteome for Drosophila melanogaster

The keyword [complete proteome](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0181) has been added to all [Drosophila melanogaster](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7227) entries in to UniProtKB. This is the second metazoa to have the keyword added; the other one being [Caenorhabditis elegans](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/6239). Eleven other eukaryotes have the keyword added; ten complete fungal genomes and [Plasmodium yoelii yoelii](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/73239). The presence of this keyword allows easy retrieval of a complete non-redundant set of proteins from the Drosophila melanogaster genome (nuclear and mitochondrial) across the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL sections of the UniProt Knowledgebase. To add the keyword, all fruit fly UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries have been updated for addition of the genome project reference ( [Adams et al, 2002, Science 287:2185-2195](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10731132) ), along with other relevant updates as appropriate.

UniProtKB Release 7.4 has [2361](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:7227+reviewed:yes) Drosophila melanogaster entries in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and [25453](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:7227+reviewed:no) entries in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. Addition of the keyword 'Complete proteome' will allow the retrieval of the complete nonredundant proteome consisting of [16229](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:7227+keyword:181+reviewed:yes) entries, [2329](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:7227+keyword:181+reviewed:yes) from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and [13900](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:7227+keyword:181+reviewed:no) from UniProtKB/TrEMBL. The proteome can also be [downloaded from our FTP server](ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/complete_proteomes/entries/eukaryota/DROME.dat) or from [Integr8](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8/QuickSearch.do?action=doOrgSearch&organismName=drosophila) .

## Cross-references to UniGene

Cross-references have been added to [UniGene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=UniGene), a sequence database which provides the automatic partition of GenBank sequences into a non-redundant set of gene-oriented clusters. Each UniGene cluster contains sequences that represent a unique gene, as well as related information such as the tissue types in which the gene has been expressed and map location.

Examples:

    Q9ZNT7:
    DR   UniGene; At.24021.
    DR   UniGene; At.64486.

    P59990:
    DR   UniGene; Hs.505267.
