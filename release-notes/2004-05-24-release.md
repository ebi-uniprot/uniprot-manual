# UniProtKB news

## New comment line (CC) topic: TOXIC DOSE

We have introduced a new comment (CC) line topic: TOXIC DOSE. This topic is used to store information on the poisoning potential (acute toxicity) of a toxin.

Generally this topic holds information on the LD(50) and PD(50). LD stands for "Lethal Dose". LD(50) is the amount of a toxin, given all at once, which causes the death of 50% (one half) of a group of test animals.

PD(50) stands for "Paralytic dose". It is the amount of a toxin, which causes the paralysis of 50% of a group of test animals.

Examples:

    CC   -!- TOXIC DOSE: PD(50) is 1.72 mg/kg by injection in blowfly larvae.

    CC   -!- TOXIC DOSE: LD(50) is 0.015 mg/kg by intravenous injection for
    CC       sarafotoxin-A and sarafotoxin-B, and 0.3 mg/kg for sarafotoxin-C.

## Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). For the feature key [MOD\_RES](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/mod_res), the new initially introduced controlled vocabularies for PTMs are:

-   Acetylation: All entries with annotated acetylation sites have the keyword [Acetylation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0007) .

        N-acetylalanine
        N-acetylaspartate
        N-acetylcysteine
        N-acetylglutamate
        N-acetylglycine
        N-acetylmethionine
        N-acetylproline
        N-acetylserine
        N-acetylthreonine
        N-acetyltyrosine
        N-acetylvaline
        N2-acetylarginine
        N6-acetyllysine

-   Amidation: All entries with annotated amidation sites have the keyword [Amidation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0027) .

        Alanine amide
        Arginine amide
        Aspartic acid 1-amide
        Asparagine amide
        Cysteine amide
        Glutamic acid 1-amide
        Glutamine amide
        Glycine amide
        Histidine amide
        Isoleucine amide
        Leucine amide
        Lysine amide
        Methionine amide
        Phenylalanine amide
        Proline amide
        Serine amide
        Threonine amide
        Tryptophan amide
        Tyrosine amide

-   Isomerization: All entries with annotated isomerization sites have the keyword [D-amino acid](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0208) .

        D-alanine (Ala)
        D-alanine (Ser)
