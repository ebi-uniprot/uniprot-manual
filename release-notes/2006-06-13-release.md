## Man gave names to all the... proteins

We have spent many years curating all kinds of proteins from all kinds of species. One recurring challenge is to offer an easily searchable and consistent knowledgebase dealing, in particular, with many ambiguities and discrepancies regarding protein names. Nomenclature is not only indispensable for communication, but also for literature search and entry retrieval. We feel that our experience in this field can be valuable, and that we can play a role in helping the standardization of protein nomenclature.

To take up this challenge, we created a [new document](https://www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) which describes **guidelines** used by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotators **to give each entry the most appropriate name**, called the "Recommended name" (RN). In short, an RN should follow the approved nomenclature, if it exists, and should be unique and attributed to all orthologs. Other rules deal mostly with the syntax of submitted protein names in order to have consistent and reproducible RNs in spite of the variability observed in various submissions. If our RN differs from the submitted one, the latter is kept as "alternative name". In this way we enhance the searchability, as well as the consistency, of our database.

We sincerely hope that researchers will adhere as much as possible to these guidelines for naming new proteins when publishing or submitting their data. This will make their results easily searchable, allow tracking of a given protein across related organisms and help us in our continuing effort to standardize nomenclature.

## Protein naming guidelines

The document [nameprot.txt](https://www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) lists a number of rules for naming proteins. UniProt is constantly striving to further standardize the nomenclature for a given protein across related organisms. In this context, we try to use these rules to attribute a recommended name to all the proteins of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. We also we hope that authors/laboratories will follow as much as possible these rules for naming new proteins.

## Cross-references to RZPD-ProtExp

Cross-references have been added to the [RZPD-ProtExp](http://www.rzpd.de/products/orfclones/). RZPD Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fuer Genomforschung is a non-profit service center for genomics and proteomics research. We introduced a new cross-reference to the RZPD "Full ORF Clones" product, which is a collection of validated ORF protein expression clones containing the complete coding sequences for genes.

The RZPD-ProtExp database is available at <http://www.rzpd.de/products/orfclones/> .

The format of the explicit links is:
