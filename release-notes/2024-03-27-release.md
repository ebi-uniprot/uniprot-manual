## CMV infections: plants beaten at their own game

Plants have evolved very efficient processes to protect themselves from herbivore and pathogen attacks. The jasmonate signaling pathway is a nice example of such a process. Jasmonate is lipid-based plant hormone, with a similar structure to animal prostaglandins. In the absence of jasmonate, JAZ (jasmonate ZIM domain) proteins bind to downstream transcription factors, hence silencing the expression of plant defense genes against herbivores. Following mechanical wounding or herbivory, jasmonate biosynthesis is rapidly activated. In the presence of jasmonate or its bioactive derivatives, JAZ proteins are degraded via the proteasome, freeing transcription factors for expression of genes needed for defense. Another indirect result of jasmonate signaling is the emission of volatile jasmonate-derived compounds. These can travel to nearby plants and elevate levels of transcripts related to wound response. This emission can further upregulate jasmonate biosynthesis and cell signaling, thereby inducing nearby plants to prime their defenses in case of herbivory.

Plant defense against viruses is also outstanding. The primary defense against, for instance, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is directed by antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) guided by the virus-derived small interfering RNAs. This strategy, known as post-transcriptional gene silencing, limits the accumulation of viral RNAs.

Obviously, viruses have developed counter-defense strategies. CMV encodes a viral suppressor of host RNAi, the [2b protein](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0C783), which acts at two levels. It directly [interacts with both the RNA and protein components of the plant RNA silencing machinery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25380036/). By binding to double-stranded RNAs, it inhibits the production of viral siRNAs. By interacting with the argonaute protein, it prevents argonaute slicer activity. Once the host defense is neutralized, the virus can go on replicating, but that is not the end of the story. After replication, the virus needs to propagate to other plants, and to do so, it has to attract insect vectors, in the case of CMV, aphids.

At this stage, CMV again uses the 2b protein. This time, [the 2b protein acts at the level of the jasmonate signaling pathway](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28059067/), inhibiting its activation. The 2b protein binds JAZ proteins and prevents their degradation, which would otherwise turn on the jasmonate signaling pathway. Through a yet unknown mechanism, the repression of the jasmonate signaling pathway leads to increased odor-dependent aphid attraction. Once the insects settle down on the infected plant, they suck sap and concomitantly pick up viruses to transmit them later on to other plants.

The astonishingly multifunctional CMV [2b protein](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0C783) has been manually annotated in the Swiss-Prot section of UniProtKB and is now publicly available.
