## Oocyte waste disposal strategy: 'store to degrade later'

Female fertility relies upon oocyte quality. In almost all mammals, oocytes develop before birth and must remain viable for a long time before fertilization. In humans, this time lag can last up to half a century, making oocytes the longest surviving cells in the human body. The issue for these cells is to somehow avoid the accumulation of toxic substances and to remain alive and kicking for the crucial moment of fertilization and formation of an embryo. In this context, the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins is crucial. In other cells, this is achieved through the ubiquitin-proteasome system for soluble ubiquitinated polypeptides or via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway for insoluble aggregates. Yet the breakdown process would require a great deal of energy and immature oocytes have a reduced metabolic activity. How do they meet the challenge?

[A recent study by Zaffagnini et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38382525/) showed that mouse oocytes sequester protein aggregates in large micron-sized nonmembrane-bound compartments, that they called endolysosomal vesicular assemblies or ELVAs. Such large organelles [have been previously observed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28304790,5095062,642015) in oocytes, but never characterized. ELVAs are actually clusters of endolysosomal and autophagy vesicles, including early endosomes, late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs), autophagosomes, and autolysosomes. They also contain proteasomes. In immature oocytes, ELVAs are evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the lysosomes they host are not active and the proteasomal activity is low. Upon oocyte maturation, ELVAs relocate to the cortex in an actin-dependent manner. At this stage, lysosomes gain degradative activity. The fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes increases and sequestered aggregates are degraded. The strategy of storing waste and disposing of it in one fell swoop is effective and energy efficient. ELVAs disappear during the first embryonic cleavage, which coincides with lysosomal exocytosis and the cytoplasm is clear of protein aggregates that would be detrimental for embryonic survival.

ELVAs are viscous nonmembrane-bound 'super organelles'. They held together by a matrix formed by [RUFY1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8BIJ7), a protein that contains several domains, among which are coiled coil domains. It is thought that RUFY1 drives ELVA formation through self-assembly via its [coiled-coil domains](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8BIJ7#family_and_domains).

[Mouse RUFY1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8BIJ7) and its [human ortholog](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q96T51) have been updated and are now publicly available.
