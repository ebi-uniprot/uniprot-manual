## Adding the keyword 'Complete proteome' to fungal entries

The keyword ' [Complete proteome](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0181) ' is added to UniProtKB entries which originate from an organism whose genome has been completely sequenced. Until recently this keyword was only used for proteins from complete bacterial or archaeal genomes. We want to gradually increase the scope of this keyword to other groups of species. As a first step, we have now added this keyword to entries originating from 8 complete fungal genomes, namely: Ashbya gossypii, Candida glabrata, Debaryomyces hansenii, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Yarrowia lipolytica.

The presence of this keyword allows to easily retrieve a complete non- redundant set of proteins from a specified genome across the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL sections of the UniProt Knowledgebase.

# UniProtKB News

## New Swiss-Prot document: humsavar.txt

The new Swiss-Prot document [humsavar.txt](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/humsavar) includes an index of sequence variation in human proteins. For each [variant annotated in the feature table (FT)](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/variant) of the Swiss-Prot entry of a human protein, the following information is indicated:

-   gene name
-   Swiss-Prot entry name and accession number
-   [feature identifier (FTId)](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/userman.htm#FTID)
-   protein sequence position
-   amino acid substitution
-   type of variant (polymorphism or disease mutation; unclassified, if unknown)
-   disease name for disease variants

A text-only version of this index can be [downloaded by ftp](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/docs/humsavar.txt) .
