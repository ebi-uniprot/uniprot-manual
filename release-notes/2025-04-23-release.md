## Brain property: no trespassing

Over [60% of people under age 50](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus) are seropositive for [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)](https://viralzone.expasy.org/5756). Most people with HSV have no symptoms or mild symptoms, such as blisters (cold sores). However, some rare individuals, [about 1-2 per 100,000 per year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557643/), develop HSV encephalitis (HSE). Up to 70% of patients die without treatment. With acyclovir treatment, mortality falls to about 20%, but most survivors suffer from neurological sequelae, which are often severe. Remarkably, during HSE, the virus remains in the central nervous system (CNS), but does not spread to other tissues. Conversely, in patients with leukocyte immunodeficiencies, HSV-1 can circulate in the bloodstream and infect various mucocutaneous tissues, but usually not the CNS. The brain has a limited self-renewal capacity and is extremely sensitive to damage, not only that caused by infection, but also by inflammation. Taken together, these observations suggest the brain may have evolved a specific strategy to limit HSV replication, without activating inflammation.

This question was investigated in [two recent publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39048823,39048830) that have identified TMEFF1 ([transmembrane protein with EGF-like and one follistatin-like domain](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8IYR6)), as a brain-specific HSV restriction factor. Indeed, TMEFF1 knockout mice exhibit increased susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the brain, but not in the periphery. In various experimental settings, TMEFF1 appeared to be both required and sufficient to control HSV-1 infection and it does not act through a mechanism affecting the type I interferon response pathway. In addition, in two HSE patients, rare TMEFF1 variants were found, that were directly linked to the control of viral infection.

TMEFF1 is a transmembrane protein located within the plasma membrane. In humans and mice, it is predominantly expressed in the brain, and more specifically in neurons. It does not affect virus binding to the cell surface, but it prevents its entry into cells. To achieve its goal, TMEFF1 does not bind to any HSV-1 protein tested, but rather to host proteins NECTIN1, NMMHC-IIA (MYH9) and NMMHC-IIB (MYH10), which have been reported to be [involved in HSV-1 entry through the viral protein gB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20944748,25428876). How exactly TMEFF1 prevents HSV-1 entry is not yet entirely clear. It does not compete with NECTIN1 binding to gB, but it allows the formation of a ternary complex between NECTIN1, MYH9 and MYH10, which may be important for the fusion process between the virus and host cell. In addition to acting at the level of virus entry, TMEFF1 also impairs HSV-1 replication after entry mediated by either NECTIN1 or HVEM, with a stronger effect on NECTIN1-dependent entry. Here too the mechanism is still unknown.

There is one [other known example of tissue-specific, type I interferon-independent virus restriction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30068544/). In keratinocytes, the EVER (TMC6/TMC8)-CIB1 complex protects keratinocytes from human [betapapilloma viruses](https://viralzone.expasy.org/188?outline=all_by_species). Inherited deficiencies of this complex underlie various forms of epidermodysplasia verruciformis. Understanding the mechanisms of type I interferon-independent protection might allow the development of new therapeutic approaches against defined viruses. For instance TMEFF1 interacts with NECTIN1 via its extracellular N-terminal domain, therefore it might be interesting to investigate if a soluble form of this domain can help fight HSV infection in the CNS or other organs.

The [TMEFF1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8IYR6) UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry has been updated and is publicly available.

### Change of URIs for the HAMAP database

For historic reasons, UniProt had to generate URIs to cross-reference databases that did not have an RDF representation or did not provide stable URIs such as [PURLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator) (permanent uniform resource locators). The SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics has now committed to provide stable URIs for the resources that it supports, and the first database to adopt this is [HAMAP](https://hamap.expasy.org/). We have changed the HAMAP URIs accordingly:
 * The links to HAMAP signatures (used in UniProtKB cross-references and in UniParc) change from:
```
http://purl.uniprot.org/hamap/MF_00012
```
to:
```
https://purl.expasy.org/hamap/signature/MF_00012
```

 * The links to HAMAP annotation rules (used in UniProtKB attributions) change from:
```
http://purl.uniprot.org/hamap-rule/MF_00012
```
to:
```
https://purl.expasy.org/hamap/rule/MF_00012
```
