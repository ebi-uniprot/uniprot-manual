## More than 500'000 comment blocks in Swiss-Prot

One of the important aspects of the annotation process is to provide, for each protein, a description of a number of meaningful biological elements such as the function or role of a protein, its subcellular location, its membership in a specific family, etc. All of this information is stored in the [comments field (CC)](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/userman.htm#CC_line). Comments are organized by topics, 24 types of which are currently defined. A specific comment can consist of several sentences or other textual elements, which are grouped into what we term a comment block.

The total number of comment blocks has now reached the 500'000 mark, which corresponds to an average of 3.5 blocks per Swiss-Prot entry.
