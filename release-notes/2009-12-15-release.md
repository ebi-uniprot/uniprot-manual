### Through the Looking-Glass

All amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two [optical isomers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid#Isomerism), called L-or D-amino acids, which are mirror images of each other. However, we have been taught for decades that proteins that occur in nature are made out of L-forms. There are some well-known exceptions, of course, but restricted to prokaryotes. Indeed, D-forms are abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria, and are also observed in bacterial natural antibiotics, such as actinomycin D, bacitracin or tetracycline. These latter are quite unusual peptides that are synthesized by multienzyme complexes in a stepwise fashion without the participation of mRNA. It has also been observed that the mammalian brain contains high levels of free [D-serine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18564180) which appears to be a physiological coagonist of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and, as such, may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain, but this activity is carried out by the amino acid itself and does not occur within the context of a polypeptide. The isolation, in the 1980s, of naturally occurring animal peptides containing D-amino acids challenged the dogma, leading to the discovery of a new post-translational modification (PTM): L- to D-isomerization.

In 1981, [Montecucchi et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7287299), looking for enkephalin-related peptides in various amphibia, isolated dermorphin from the skin of [*Phyllomedusa sauvagei*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/8395). [Dermorphin](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=name:dermorphin+AND+taxonomy:8395) is produced by 2 different precursors: cleavage of [Dermorphin-1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P05422) gives rise to 4 mature dermorphins and that of [Dermorphin-2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P05421) to 5 mature peptides, all of which have the identical sequence: YAFGYPS. This heptapeptide binds with high affinity and selectivity to mu-type opioid receptors and appears to be [a thousand times more potent than morphine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7195758) in inducing deep long-lasting analgesia when injected into mice or rats. Interestingly, the second amino acid of dermorphin is D-alanine. A synthetic isomer, containing L-alanine at that position, is virtually devoid of biological activity.

This discovery was followed by many others. [Deltorphins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:%22Metazoa+%5B33208%5D%22+AND+keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22+AND+name:deltorphin), another class of frog opioid peptides, also characterized by a D-amino acid at position 2, were isolated. Another amphibian, [*Bombina variegata*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/8348), was shown to express antimicrobial D-amino acid-containing peptides, called [bombesins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22+AND+taxonomy:8348), on its skin. [Arthropoda](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22+AND+taxonomy:6656), such as spider, lobsters and crayfish, and [Mollusca](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22+taxonomy:6447) entered the game. [Cone snail peptide toxins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22+AND+taxonomy:6490) have been extensively studied in this context and they currently represent 60% of all animal [D-amino acid-containing proteins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:%22Metazoa+%5B33208%5D%22+AND+keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22&by=taxonomy#6656,6447,32523) annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. A single mammal appears on the list: [platypus](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22+taxonomy:9258) with 2 peptides, [C-type natriuretic peptide 39](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P84715) and [Defensin-like peptide 2/4](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P82140), expressed in its venom gland.

Animal D-amino acid-containing proteins are synthesized on ribosomes following a classical mRNA template; unusual codons have not been observed. In addition, some of them have been isolated from their [biological source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7973665,8034574) with both L- and D-amino acid at the appropriate position. These observations suggested that L- to D-amino acid isomerization is a bona fide PTM. An enzyme catalyzing the conversion of an [Omega-agatoxin-Aa4b](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P37045) serine (at position 46 of the mature peptide, [81 in the precursor](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P37045#section_features) ) from L- to D-form [has been isolated](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7622482) from the funnel-web spider *Agelenopsis aperta* and its [partial sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=q9txd8+OR+q9twh3) is available in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. A similar mammalian activity [has been characterized](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16480722) from platypus venom.

L- to D-amino acid isomerization presents significant advantages. The modified peptides become more resistant to protease degradation and hence much more stable. In addition, X-ray crystallography studies have shown that the isomerization creates new structures, such as peculiar beta-turns. The creation of these new structural elements seems crucial for interaction with specific partners, opiate receptors for instance, and may act as a switch that turns on protein activity.

L- to D-amino acid isomerization could be more frequent than initially thought. It cannot be predicted by software tools and is not detectable by any of the standard techniques used in proteomics. It was only discovered when a synthetic peptide with the same sequence of L-amino acids appeared to be biologically inactive. We could be facing a novel strategy of multicellular organisms to circumvent stereochemical limitations imposed by the genetic code in an effort to increase molecular diversity.

In UniProtKB, all [D-amino acid-containing proteins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22) can be retrieved using the keyword ['D-amino acid'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0208). To restrict the search to [animal proteins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:33208+AND+keyword:%22D-amino+acid%22), add ['Metazoa'](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/33208) to the taxonomy field.
