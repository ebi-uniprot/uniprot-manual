## Some like it hot

Peppers of the [Capsicum genus](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/4071) in the Solanaceae family are native to the Americas and were among the first crops domesticated about 10,000 B.C.E. Interestingly, five different species were independently domesticated in separate regions of the Americas, suggesting a strong interest from humans, possibly because peppers have been used very early in culinary practices and in medicine. Nowadays, peppers are among the most important vegetable and spice crops in the world. Some 3,000 different pepper types are grown worldwide, that differ not only in the color of their fruits or their shape, but more importantly by their heat profile.

Most solanaceous plants protect themselves from herbivores by producing high levels of toxic alkaloids in their leaves. Peppers have evolved another, somewhat more palatable mechanism, one which also aids their propagation; they produce capsaicinoids in their fruit. While not toxic, capsaicinoids bind and activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (or [TRPV1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=%28gene%3ATRPV1%29+AND+%28taxonomy_id%3A40674%29&facets=reviewed%3Atrue)) in the mouth, eliciting a heat sensation ferocious enough to discourage mammalian herbivores. Birds, which do not express TRPV1, do not feel the heat; they are attracted to the small red fruit on wild plants and eat them, thereby disseminating their seeds.

The first step of the biosynthetic pathway of capsaicinoids is the synthesis of [vanillin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:18346) from phenylalanine via the phenylpropanoid pathway. [Vanillin can be converted to vanillylamine](https://www.rhea-db.org/rhea/63828) by the [pAMT enzyme](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/E1AQY3/entry), also called VAMT. Vanillylamine then undergoes [condensation with a branched fatty acid](https://www.rhea-db.org/rhea/63832), catalyzed by [PUN1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296471). Any variations in the chemical structure of the capsaicinoids, mainly linked to the structure of the acyl moieties attached to the benzene ring of vanillylamine, change [our perception not only of the heat intensity, but more generally the heat profile](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28662907/) with its myriad of sensations (irritating, mellow-warming, sharp, developing quickly, receding rapidly, lasting hours, etc.)

However, [vanillin can also be converted to vanillyl alcohol](https://www.rhea-db.org/rhea/76611). The enzyme catalyzing this reaction has long been elusive. It has been recently identified by [Sano et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35858994/) as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (or [CAD1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/B5LAT8/entry)), an enzyme well-known to plant biologists, because it is essential for the synthesis of lignin, a major cell wall component. Vanillyl alcohol is also a substrate for PUN1. In this case, the condensation with fatty acids produces capsinoids. These are structurally similar to capsaicinoids, except that they have an ester bond instead of an amide bond between the aromatic ring and the branched fatty acid. This small difference makes them mild. The ratio between capsaicinoids and capsinoids determines capsicum pungency. [Low-pungent peppers contain a higher content of capsinoids with small amounts of capsaicinoids](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11032-015-0339-9). Hence the conversion of vanillin into either vanillylamine or vanillyl alcohol is instrumental to determine spiciness.

Whether you like it hot or not, you may enjoy looking at our brand new UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries for capsicum enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of capsaicinoids/capsinoids, [pAMT](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/E1AQY3/entry), [CAD1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/B5LAT8/entry) and [PUN1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/D2Y3X2/entry), which are publicly available as of this release.

# UniProtKB news

## Change of the cross-references to TAIR

We have modified our cross-references to the [TAIR](https://www.arabidopsis.org/) database, and now use the TAIR locus name as the resource identifier, and present the primary gene symbol in an additional field.

### Text format

Example: [Q8GW48](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8GW48.txt)

Previous format:

```
DR   TAIR; locus:1005716315; AT4G15802.
```

New format:

## Change of the cross-references to TIGRFAMs: replaced by NCBIfam

We have updated our cross-references to reflect the transfer of the [TIGRFAMs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/tigrfams/) database to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which now holds the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license to this data and is responsible for maintaining and distributing this intellectual property. Following their transfer to NCBI, TIGRFAMs models are now part of a larger HMM collection, [NCBIfam](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/evidence/), a collection of HMMs built by NCBI curators. All UniProtKB entries cross-referenced to NCBIfam can be found [here](https://www.uniprot.org/database/DB-0270).

## Change of evidence code for the ProtNLM method

The April 2023 release of the [ECO ontology](https://evidenceontology.org/about_eco/) introduced several new terms, including [ECO:0008006](https://ontobee.org/ontology/ECO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0008006) - "deep learning method evidence used in automatic assertion". This ECO term accurately describes the [ProtNLM](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ProtNLM) method, and we have therefore replaced the formerly used [ECO:0000256](https://ontobee.org/ontology/ECO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0000256) term by [ECO:0008006](https://ontobee.org/ontology/ECO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0008006) for [predictions generated by the ProtNLM method](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=source%3Agoogle).

# UniProt website news

Following the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2020, UniProt published all SARS-CoV-2, SARS and COVID-19 related human protein entries in a pre-release COVID-19 website portal and FTP directory for rapid dissemination of the knowledge about this virus and the COVID-19 disease. With this release, both services have been decommissioned.
