## Vitamin K beyond coagulation

The involvement of vitamin K in blood clotting has been known for about a century now (see [UniProt headline](https://www.uniprot.org/release-notes/2014-10-29-release)). Vitamin K is [made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables, in which it is directly involved in photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K). In animal cells, the vitamin undergoes the so-called canonical vitamin K cycle, in which it is first reduced into its active form by vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). It then becomes the cosubstrate for vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase (GGCX), which catalyzes gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues in target proteins, including several blood factor proteins, leading to initiation of the blood coagulation cascade. During the reaction, vitamin K is oxidized, but it is restored back to active vitamin K by VKOR, being continuously recycled.

Anticoagulant drugs, like warfarin, inhibit VKOR, blocking vitamin K recycling and depleting active vitamin K stores. Prescription of warfarin is tricky, as overdosage can cause life-threatening bleeding. The standard clinical treatment for warfarin poisoning is the administration of a high dose of vitamin K, which is well-tolerated and does not exhibit any toxicity. During the treatment, blood clotting is enabled through the action of a warfarin-resistant reductase, whose identity was long elusive.

The solution of the mystery came from a study focused on a different topic, namely ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death, characterized by the accumulation of lipid-based reactive oxygen species that results in membrane damage. It is thought to be one of the most [widespread and ancient forms of regulated cell death](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29802123/). Cells have evolved a number of highly efficient redox systems that counteract uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. One of them is mediated by the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1 or [AIFM2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=(gene%3AAIFM2)+AND+(taxonomy_id%3A7742)+AND+%28reviewed%3Atrue%29)) in the presence of ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q10, CoQ10): [reduced CoQ10 traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, whereas FSP1 catalyzes the regeneration of CoQ10 using NAD(P)H](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31634899/). Vitamin K shares structural similarities with CoQ10, hence testing FSP1's activity on vitamin K seemed a natural extension. The results are striking: reduced vitamin K produced by FSP1 actively prevents lipid peroxidation. The reaction is not sensitive to warfarin.

The discovery of a new function for vitamin K, as a guardian against ferroptosis, may also have an impact on clinical practice. As a consequence of vasoconstriction, thrombosis, or embolism, tissues can experience a restriction in blood supply, called ischemia, causing a shortage of oxygen that is needed for cellular metabolism. Paradoxically, restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic tissues can cause the exacerbation of cellular dysfunction and death through the induction of oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a phenomenon known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). In an IRI mouse model, [Mishima et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35922516/) showed that vitamin K supplementation could prevent tissue-damaging inflammation in the liver or kidneys. Vitamin K could also prevent ferroptosis in neurons.
