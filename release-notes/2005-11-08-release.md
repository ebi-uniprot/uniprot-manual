## A city-sized crowd of authors

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a manually annotated protein knowledgebase. This involves not only sequence curation, but also a critical review of the scientific literature. All references used to create an entry are always cited, whether they are complex publications or simple submissions. Currently, there are more than [1'600 journals](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/jourlist) referenced in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, and more than 210'000 distinct authors.

Bringing all these authors together for a meeting would result in a gathering of a size similar to that of [Geneva](http://www.ville-ge.ch/en/decouvrir/en-bref/index.htm), the city where UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot was created and is still based... A small, Swiss city with an international vocation, a little like UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, which began as a local project of a graduate student with quite an ambitious aim: providing the scientific community throughout the world with a central hub for sharing biological knowledge. To achieve this goal, the Swiss-Prot group very quickly developped a strong and fruitful collaboration with the European Institute of Bioinformatics (EBI) and more recently with the Protein Information Resource (PIR) of the Georgetown University Medical Center in USA ( <http://www.uniprot.org/> ). The Swiss-Prot group is not only international but also interdisciplinary. Various educational backgrounds are mixed: biologists, biochemists, programmers, mathematicians, wet lab experts or students, etc. This team work is what ensures the quality of the knowledgebase.
