# UniProtKB News

## Extension of the Swiss-Prot entry name format

We endeavor to assign meaningful entry names that facilitate the identification of the proteins and the species of origin. Swiss-Prot uses a general purpose naming convention that can be symbolized as X_Y, where X is a mnemonic code of alphanumeric characters representing the protein name, the '\_' sign serves as a separator, and the Y is a mnemonic species identification code of at most 5 alphanumeric characters representing the biological source of the protein.

The entry name used to consist of up to ten uppercase alphanumeric characters. We now elongated the **mnemonic code for the protein name** from up to 4 characters to **up to 5 characters**, thus **entry names can from now on consist of up to 11 characters** .

As this modification might have an impact on many programs, we introduced in this release only one Swiss-Prot entry with an entry name in the new format: **[TINA1_DROME](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9W0Y1)** (Q9W0Y1). With **UniProtKB release 4.0** at the beginning of February, **we will change the entry names of many Swiss-Prot entries** .

We strongly advise users to cite Swiss-Prot entries by their unique and stable identifer, which is the first (primary) [accession number](https://www.uniprot.org/manual/accession) of an entry. It happens occasionally that entries are only referred to by the entry name. As we will soon change the entry names of thousands of entries, we provide the tool [IDtracker](http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/idtracker), which allows users of the Swiss-Prot protein knowledgebase to trace the identifiers (ID) of protein entries.

## Cross-references to Ensembl

Cross-references have been added to the [Ensembl database](http://www.ensembl.org/), a bioinformatics project that organizes biological information around the sequences of large genomes. Ensembl is available at [http://www.ensembl.org](http://www.ensembl.org/).

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:
