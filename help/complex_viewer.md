The Complex Viewer visualizes protein complexes expertly curated by the [Complex Portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal), an encyclopaedic resource of macromolecular complexes. The Viewer allows the user to study the internal topology and stoichiometry of a complex, when this is known, and clicking on a node enables the visualization of any recognized binding domains. 

When a protein is found in more than one complex, a full list of these can be accessed via the associated pulldown menu.

More information on the complex can be accessed using the link ‘View in the Complex Portal’ or via the Complex Portal entry(ies) in the ‘Cross-reference’ section. 
A full list of the UniProtKB records of the complex components can be accessed and downloaded using the link ‘View interactors in UniProtKB’
