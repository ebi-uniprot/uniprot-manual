The Complex Viewer visualizes protein complexes expertly curated by the [Complex Portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal), an encyclopaedic resource of macromolecular complexes. The Viewer allows the user to study the internal topology and stoichiometry of a complex, when this is known, and clicking on a node enables the visualization of any recognized binding domains. 

When a protein is found in more than one complex, a full list of these can be accessed via the associated pulldown menu. Example: [Q9BQE9](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9BQE9/entry#interaction)

More information on the complex can be accessed using the link `View in the Complex Portal` or via the Complex Portal entry(ies) in the [Cross-reference section](https://www.uniprot.org/help/cross_references_section). 
A full list of the UniProtKB records of the complex components can be accessed and downloaded using the link `View interactors in UniProtKB`.
