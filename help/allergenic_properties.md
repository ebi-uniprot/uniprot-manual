This subsection of the ['Disease/Phenotypes and variants'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/disease_phenotypes_variants_section) section is used for proteins that cause an allergic reaction in mammals. We usually specify in which species the protein is allergenic.

Example: [Q06811](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q06811#phenotypes_variants)

There is however an exception for an enzyme that does not cause allergic reaction by itself, but catalyzes a modification responsible for multiple allergies in human.  
Example: [P45669](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P45669#phenotypes_variants)
