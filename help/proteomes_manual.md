This subsection of the [Names and taxonomy](https://www.uniprot.org/help/names_and_taxonomy_section) section is present for entries that are part of a [proteome](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes), i.e. of a set of proteins thought to be expressed by organisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced.

A UniProt entry can be linked to one or more proteomes. For each proteome, the information displayed in this section consists of a [proteome ID (UPID)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_id) and a [component name](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_component).
