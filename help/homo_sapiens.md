# Human proteome

In 2008, a draft of the complete human proteome was released from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: the approximately 20,000 putative human protein-coding genes were represented by one UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, later linked to [proteome identifier](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_id) UP000005640. This UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot H. sapiens proteome (manually reviewed) can be considered as complete in the sense that it contains one representative (canonical) sequence for each currently known human gene. About half of these 20'000 entries contain manually annotated alternative isoforms, representing over 22'000 additional sequences.

# Human diseases

This document lists the controlled vocabulary that is used for the annotation of human diseases in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Each record in this file consists of a disease identifier, acronym, and description, as well as known disease synonyms, links to OMIM, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and associated UniProtKB keywords.

# Human blood group antigen proteins

Blood group antigens are surface markers on the outside of the red blood cell membrane. The relevant UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries are classified into 28 different blood group systems.

# Human and mouse protein kinases

Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a universal cell-signaling fundamental process in eukaryotic cells. The list of all UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human and mouse protein kinases, systematically classified (e.g.Â PKA, PKC, Tyr), is aimed at facilitating the retrieval of all kinases of the human and mouse kinomes.

# Human cell differentiation molecules (CD)

The CD nomenclature was intended for the classification of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), generated by laboratories around the world, against various cell surface molecules on leukocytes (white blood cells). CD antibodies are used widely for research, differential diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of disease.
