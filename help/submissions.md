# Sequence data flow into UniProt

We import protein sequences from a range of collaborative resources during our production cycle, for more information on these sources please see our [help page](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_origin).

UniProt creates novel protein entries for sequences imported from a variety of sources, including; 
<ul>
  <li>Translated nucleotide sequences from ENA</li>
  <li>Direct protein sequencing using Edman degradation or manual interpretation of MS spectra</li>
  <li>De novo peptide sequencing</li>
</ul>

We import proteomics peptide data from publicly available datasets in ProteomeXchange to support the [existence](https://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_existence) of proteins in the UniProt database.

# Submitting data to UniProt

If you have protein sequences that are a result of nucleotide translations, e.g. from genetic sequencing or mRNA sequence, then please submit to the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/submit).

We import [proteomics data](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteomics) from bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) experiments in which peptides are searched against a reference peptide database. If you have MS data where a search algorithm (such as Mascot) has been used to identify protein matches from experimental peptides then please submit to [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/pridesubmissiontool) or [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp?redirect=auth) databases.

UniProt accepts direct submissions of previously uncharacterized protein sequences by Edman degradation sequencing or peptide sequences deduced by manual determination of individual amino acids based on their a/b/c/x/y/z ions. Protein sequences must be novel and not match the sequence of a current UniProt protein entry. To check if your protein sequence is already in UniProt please use our [BLAST tool](https://www.uniprot.org/blast). To submit directly to UniProt please use the [SPIN portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Submissions/spin/account/login;jsessionid=67E1CA0F482E1BE0CCDB057F9E441C2E).

For novel protein sequences that have been identified by de novo sequencing software (such as PEAK DB and DeepNovo) that identifies protein sequences without searching against a reference sequence database please email: uniprot-submissions@ebi.ac.uk with your methodology, protein sequence and species information.

# UniProt update requests

## Associate publications and annotations to a protein entry. 

We welcome the addition of publications and annotations from the scientific community via our [community submission system](https://community.uniprot.org/bbsub/home.html). 
Sign in using your [ORCID](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us) and receive recognition for your contribution to the UniProt database.

## Requesting corrections or entry updates.

If you have feedback relating to the content of protein entries, including corrections and requests to update the content of an entry please navigate to the entry in question and use our feedback tab on the right of the screen.
