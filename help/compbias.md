This subsection of the 'Family and Domains' section describes the position of regions of compositional bias within the protein and the particular type of amino acids that are over-represented within those regions.

Regions of compositional bias are predicted by the [MobiDB-lite method](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx015). These computationally generated annotations are tagged with the evidence code `ECO:0000256` (sequence model evidence used in automatic assertion) and source `SAM:MobiDB-lite`, in both reviewed and unreviewed entries.

The over-represented type of amino acid within the annotated computationally biased region are further characterized, e.g.Â as "Cys residues", "Gly residues", "Pro residues", "Polar residues", "Basic residues", "Acidic residues" or "Basic and acidic residues", but also "Low complexity".
