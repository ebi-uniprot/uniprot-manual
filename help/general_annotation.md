title: General annotation (Comments)
type: help
categories: manual
---

Position-independent general annotations used to be found in the 'General annotation (Comments)' section in previous versions of the UniProtKB entry view. They provide any useful information about the protein, mostly biological knowledge. General annotations are frequently written in free text, although we increasingly try to standardize them and use controlled vocabulary wherever possible. The text and XML formats still group all general annotation together in a "Comments section" (CC).

The current entry view displays annotation by subject (Function, PTM & processing, etc), and the various "general" annotations are distributed across the relevant sections.
The same holds true for [Sequence annotations (Features)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_annotation).

# Querying Comments

Individual comments can be queried using the query fields described in the tables above. Querying is of the form:

```bash
curl "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/api/uniprotkb/search?query=FIELD:VALUE"
```

For example, to find all Human entries with catalyctic activity, we could run the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/api/uniprotkb/search?query=cc_catalytic_activity:* AND organism_id:9606"
```

## Comments evidences

For any comment field, a corresponding field exists denoting its attached evidences (for a complete list of evidences, refer to [Evidences](https://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences). Given a comment, `cc_XXXX`, its evidences can be queried via, `ccev_XXXX`. For example, to find Human entries with comment catalytic activity and a non-traceable evidence, we can execute the following command:

```
curl "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/api/uniprotkb/search?query=cc_catalytic_activity:* AND ccev_catalytic_activity:ECO_0000303 AND organism_id:9606"
```
