The UniProt consortium does not sell any biological products, neither proteins nor organisms. To obtain additional commercial information you need to access the on-line catalogs of the many suppliers of biochemicals and reagents for the life sciences.

To the best of our knowledge this information is not available in any exhaustive public compilation i.e.Â one that includes all suppliers. There are some exceptions such as, for example, the commercial availability of restriction enzymes which can be obtained from the [REBASE database](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html) or for peptides (amino acids, peptide synthesis reagents, or peptides) from the [Peptide Resource Page](https://www.csbio.com/peptides.html). Another useful site may be the [Enzyme Directory](http://www.enzymedirectory.com/). 

For certain entries, the UniProtKB database provides annotation which may be of interest in this context.

1. UniProtKB has cross-references to some [Protocols and materials databases](https://www.uniprot.org/database?facets=category_exact%3AProtocols+and+materials+databases&query=*) including a number of antibody providers.
   
    You could therefore look for your protein in UniProtKB and check whether there are cross-references to ABCD, CPTC Antibody Portal or Antibodypedia, under "External links", Protocols and materials databases. 

2. Certain entries have a [Biotechnological use](https://www.uniprot.org/help/biotechnological_use) subsection which describes the use of a specific protein in a biotechnological process. It explains in a few words in which biotechnological process the protein is used or could be used with an explanation that describes the commercial use of the protein.

3. Where applicable, the UniProtKB database also provides a [Pharmaceutical use](https://www.uniprot.org/help/pharmaceutical_use) subsection which describes the name under which the protein is available as a the drug and the name of the firm that commercializes it.
   
    Example: [P01275](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P01275#phenotypes_variants):
    Available under the names Glucagon (Eli Lilly) and GlucaGen or Glucagon Novo Nordisk (Novo Nordisk). Used to treat severe hypoglycemia in insulin-dependent diabetics.
