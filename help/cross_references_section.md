This section is used to point to information related to entries and found in data collections other than UniProtKB.

The databases to which UniProtKB is cross-referenced can be listed and searched in ['Cross-referenced databases'](https://www.uniprot.org/database). Each database is described by its name and abbreviation and a link to its web server is provided, as well as literature references where available.

Additional and complementary information can be found in the subsection [Web resources](https://www.uniprot.org/help/web_resource).

# List of categories of the databases cross-referenced in UniProtKB

# Cross-references to 'Sequence databases'

If a sequence submitted to EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ present some discrepancies with the [canonical sequence](https://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical_and_isoforms), these latter are documented in the ['Sequence conflict'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/conflict) subsection of the 'Sequence' section. However, if these discrepancies are severe, the underlying cross-reference to EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ is tagged.

Four different tags are used to mark problematic sequences submitted to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases:

- 'Frameshift': discrepancies are due to the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides in the submitted nucleotide sequence.  
  Example: [O14467](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O14467/external-links)

- 'Different initiation': discrepancies are due to an erroneous initiation codon choice in the submitted sequence.  
  Example: [Q9LEH8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9LEH8/external-links)

- 'Different termination': the termination codon of the submitted sequence differs from that of the sequence displayed  
  Example: [P35545](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P35545/external-links)

- 'Sequence problems': discrepancies are due to an erroneous gene model prediction, erroneous ORF assignement, miscellaneous discrepancy, etc.  
  Example: [Q7XR80](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q7XR80/external-links), [Q8TBF5](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8TBF5/external-links)

The discrepancies are described in more details in the ['Sequence Caution'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_caution) section.

If no CoDing Sequence (CDS) has been annotated in a submitted nucleotide sequence (most frequently genomic sequence), the corresponding cross-reference is tagged with the label: 'No translation available'.  
Example: [B2RU33](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/B2RU33/external-links)
