Historically, UniProtKB has described a few classes of ligand binding sites with dedicated annotation types to make it easier to query them. This has been the case for 'Calcium binding', 'Metal binding' and 'Nucleotide binding'. With the [switch to the ChEBI ontology](https://www.uniprot.org/release-notes/2022-08-03-release) for ligand classification, this is no longer necessary: These annotation types were deprecated, and the existing data was converted to [Binding site](https://www.uniprot.org/help/binding) annotations.
