This subsection of the [Function](https://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection) section describes a region in the protein which binds nucleotide phosphates. It always involves more than one amino acid and includes all residues involved in nucleotide-binding.

Isolated residues that bind nucleotides are shown as ' [Binding site](https://www.uniprot.org/help/binding) '.

Example: [Q9UJ70](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9UJ70#function)

The nature of the nucleotide phosphate which is bound is indicated in the description field, as is any additional information such as the affinity for nucleotide phosphates or uncertainty concerning the precise nucleotide phosphate that is bound.  
Examples: [P16905](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P16905#function), [P33164](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P33164#function), [P23170](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P23170#function)

When a protein contains several nucleotide phosphate binding sites then they may be numbered.  
Example: [P16905](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P16905#function)

We annotate experimentally determined nucleotide binding sites which can be propagated to closely related homologs or within a well-known family (such as serine/threonine protein kinases) using the 'By similarity' evidence.  
Examples: [Q2M2I8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q2M2I8#function), [Q00582](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q00582#function)

We also annotate predicted ATP-binding sites using 'Sequence analysis' evidence, when the presence of such sites is consistent with the function of the protein.  
Example: [P30621](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P30621#function)
