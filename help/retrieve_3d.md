Using the [advanced search](https://www.uniprot.org/help/advanced_search) functionality; 

- Select Searching in ‘UniProtKB’
- In the field dropdown list, type ‘PDB’ and select the suggestion ‘Cross-references/3D structure database/PDB’
- In the text box enter the value ‘*’ (to find all structures) or a relevant PDB ID of interest.
- You will see a [results table](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=%28database%3Apdb%29) of protein entries that contain PDB 3D structure cross-references.

Alternatively enter into the search field [‘database:pdb’](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=database%3Apdb) to search for all entries containing a PDB cross-reference or enter [‘xref:pdb-2VLK’](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=xref%3Apdb-2VLK) to search for entries containing the PDB ID 2VLK.
