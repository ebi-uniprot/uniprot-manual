**What is the canonical sequence?**

Each UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry contains all curated protein products encoded by a given gene in a given species or strain. For each UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, we choose a canonical (or representative) sequence for display that should conform to at least one of the following criteria:

1.  It is functional;
2.  It is widely expressed;
3.  It is encoded by conserved exons found in orthologous sequences;
4.  It is identical to consensus sequences chosen by other resources and genome curation efforts such as CCDS and MANE (see also [UniProt's human proteome](https://www.uniprot.org/help/human%5Fproteome) )
5.  In the absence of any information, we choose the longest sequence.

Sequences chosen according to these criteria generally allow the description of the majority of functionally important [domains](https://www.uniprot.org/help/domain), [motifs](https://www.uniprot.org/help/motif), [sites](https://www.uniprot.org/help/site), and [post-translational modifications](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm%5Fprocessing%5Fsection), naturally occurring [variants](https://www.uniprot.org/help/variant) with functional and clinical significance, and other [sequence features](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fannotation).

Additional information can be found in the ['Alternative sequence'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/var%5Fseq) subsection.

The various UniProtKB distribution formats (Flat Text, XML, RDF/XML) display only the canonical sequence. The website's ['Sequences'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences%5Fsection) section displays the canonical sequence, but for convenience it offers also a view of the isoforms that are described in the 'Alternative sequence' subsection.

**Are all isoforms described in one UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry?**

Whenever possible, all the protein products encoded by one gene in a given species are described in a single UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, including isoforms generated by alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative translation initiation (\*). However, some alternative splicing isoforms derived from the same gene share only a few exons, if any at all, the same for some 'trans-splicing' events. In these cases, the divergence is obviously too important to merge all protein sequences into a single entry and the isoforms have to be described in separate 'external' entries.

Example: [isoforms derived from the lola gene (Drosophila melanogaster)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P42284#sequences)

(\*) Important remark: Due to the increase of sequence data coming from large-scale sequencing projects, UniProtKB/TrEMBL may contain additional predicted sequences encoded by genes which are described in a UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry.

**How can I retrieve isoform sequences?**

Alternative sequences, described in either single or separate entries, are all available for Blast searches.

Isoform sequences can be downloaded in FASTA format from our [FTP download index page](https://www.uniprot.org/downloads) (choose the file: 'Isoform sequences').

Query-derived sets of canonical sequences alone or canonical and isoform sequences can also be downloaded in FASTA format (see [How to retrieve sets of UniProtKB protein sequences?](https://www.uniprot.org/help/retrieve%5Fsets) ).
