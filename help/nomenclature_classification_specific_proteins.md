### Allergens

A nomenclature system exists for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans and is applied to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.

### Glycosyl hydrolases

O-Glycosyl hydrolases ([EC 3.2.1.-](http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/3.2.1.-)) are a widespread group of enzymes which hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. The IUB-MB Enzyme nomenclature of glycosyl hydrolases is based on their substrate specificity and occasionally on their molecular mechanism; such a classification does not reflect (and was not intended to) the structural features of these enzymes. A classification of glycosyl hydrolases in families based on amino acid sequence similarities has been proposed.

### Human blood group antigen proteins

Blood group antigens are surface markers on the outside of the red blood cell membrane. The relevant UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries are classified into 28 different blood group systems.

### Human and mouse protein kinases

Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a universal cell-signaling fundamental process in eukaryotic cells. The list of all UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human and mouse protein kinases, systematically classified (e.g. PKA, PKC, Tyr), is aimed at facilitating the retrieval of all kinases of the human and mouse kinomes.

### Human cell differentiation molecules (CD)

The CD nomenclature was intended for the classification of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), generated by laboratories around the world, against various cell surface molecules on leukocytes (white blood cells). CD antibodies are used widely for research, differential diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of disease.

### Metallothioneins

Metallothioneins (MTs) are cysteine-rich metalloproteins responsible for regulating the intracellular supply of the biologically essential zinc and copper ions and for protecting cells from the deleterious effects of exposure to elevated amounts of metal ions such as Cd2+, Hg2+ and others.

### Peptidase families

Peptidases (also termed proteases, proteinases and proteolytic enzymes) are enzymes that conduct proteolysis, i.e. hydrolysis of the peptide bonds.

### Restriction enzymes and methylases

A restriction enzyme (or restriction endonuclease) is an enzyme that cuts DNA at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified according to their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another.

### Ribosomal proteins

Ribosomal proteins are the proteins that, in conjunction with rRNA, make up the large and small ribosomal subunits involved in the cellular process of translation.

### Scorpion potassium channel toxins

Nomenclature systems exist to classify the potassium channel-specific scorpion toxins alpha-, gamma- and kappa-KTx.

### Vertebrate homeotic Hox proteins

The homeotic Hox proteins are sequence-specific transcription factor which are part of a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with specific positional identities on the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis.
