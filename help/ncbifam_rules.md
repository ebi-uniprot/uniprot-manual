NCBIfam rules are based on equivalog protein family models (owned and maintained by NCBI, and encompass TIGRFAMs), where these models describe proteins homologous to each other and conserved in function since their last common ancestor. To know more about equivalog models, please consult the [TIGRFAM article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC29844/) and [NCBI website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/annotation_prok/tigrfams/).

We are adding some NCBIfam rules to UniProt. Following this link, you can find the [UniProtKB entries with NCBIfam annotations](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=source%3Ancbifam).
