This subsection of the 'Disease/Phenotypes and variants' section provides information on the disease(s) associated with genetic variations in a given protein. The information is extracted from the scientific literature and diseases that are also described in the [OMIM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim) database are represented with a [controlled vocabulary](https://www.uniprot.org/diseases) in the following way:

Disease name (Disease abbreviation) \[Link to OMIM\]: Disease description.

An optional "Note=" field is used to describe the role of the gene/protein in disease pathogenesis and distinguish, when possible, between causative, susceptibility and modifier genes according to literature and OMIM reports.

Examples: [Q01718](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q01718#phenotypes_variants), [Q15198](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q15198#phenotypes_variants), [P51800](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P51800#phenotypes_variants) and [P51801](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P51801#phenotypes_variants), [Q6W5P4](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q6W5P4#phenotypes_variants), [P52895](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P52895#phenotypes_variants) and [P17516](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P17516#phenotypes_variants).

The "Note=" field is also used to indicate the role of a protein in disease manifestation in cases where the protein is functionally impaired although the corresponding coding gene does not contain any mutation.

Examples:  
[P15289](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P15289#phenotypes_variants) (causative gene [Q8NBK3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8NBK3#phenotypes_variants))  
[Q15465](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q15465#phenotypes_variants) (causative gene [Q8WVP7](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8WVP7#phenotypes_variants))  
[Q9NR56](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9NR56#phenotypes_variants) (causative gene [Q09013](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q09013#phenotypes_variants))

The accession numbers of OMIM entries that describe a phenotype (or a gene and phenotype) are shown in this subsection, as well as in the 'Organism-Specific Databases' subsection of the ['Cross-references'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/cross_references_section) section, which also provides links to OMIM entries that describe the gene itself.

Examples: [Q01718](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q01718#phenotypes_variants), [P84996](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P84996#phenotypes_variants)

Chromosomal rearrangements (translocations, inversions) are also described in this subsection.

Examples: [P11308](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P11308#phenotypes_variants), [Q15532](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q15532#phenotypes_variants), [Q16385](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q16385#phenotypes_variants)

If the sequence position of the translocation breakpoint is known and causes a fusion protein, it is annotated in the ['Site'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/site) subsection.

Example: In Q8IZP0 the annotation in the ['Disease/Phenotypes and variants'](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8IZP0#phenotypes_variants_section) section is completed by information at the sequence level (['Site'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/site) subsection).

Related keyword: [Chromosomal rearrangement](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/160).

Disease information that is not described in OMIM is annotated as free text.

Examples: [P00395](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00395#phenotypes_variants), [Q02388](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q02388#phenotypes_variants)
