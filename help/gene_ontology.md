The [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-documentation/) describes knowledge of the biological domain with respect to three aspects:

- Molecular function
- Biological process
- Cellular component

A [variety of groups](http://geneontology.org/docs/annotation-contributors/), including UniProtKB curators, use GO terms to annotate gene products in a computationally tractable manner. UniProt lists the annotated GO terms in the 'Function' section; the GO terms from the 'Cellular component' category can also be seen in 'Subcellular location' section. The project that made the annotation is shown as the 'Source', and a click on this label will display the supporting [type of evidence](https://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences#evidence-types-used-for-go-annotations). When available, a link to the relevant publications is provided.

Note that many UniProtKB [subcellular locations](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/subcell.txt) and [keywords](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/keywlist.txt) have been mapped to GO terms to allow an automatic assignment of the corresponding GO terms. While the original UniProtKB subcellular locations and keywords are curated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, their automatically mapped GO term equivalents will have the evidence type "Inferred from electronic annotation".
