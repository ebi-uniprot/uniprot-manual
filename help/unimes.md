# UniMES

The obsoleted UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequences (UniMES) database was developed as a repository for metagenomic and environmental data. UniProt has [retired UniMES](https://www.uniprot.org/release-notes/2015-04-01-release) as there is now a resource at the EBI that is dedicated to serving metagenomic researchers. Henceforth, we recommend using the [EBI Metagenomics portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/) (MGnify) instead. In addition to providing a repository of metagenomics sequence data, EBI Metagenomics allows you to view functional and taxonomic analyses and to submit your own samples for analysis.
