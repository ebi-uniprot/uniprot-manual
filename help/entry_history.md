This subsection of the 'Entry information' section shows the date of integration of the entry into UniProtKB, the date of the last sequence update and the date of the last annotation modification ('Last modified'). The version number for both the entry and the [canonical sequence](https://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical%5Fand%5Fisoforms) are also displayed.

Example: [P55209](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P55209#entry%5Finformation)

Sequence updates are always accompanied by manual annotation checks and updates. Hence, the date of the last annotation update will always be at least as recent as that of the last sequence update.

Note that sequence and entry versions are not reset when the [status of an entry](https://www.uniprot.org/help/entry%5Fstatus) moves from 'Unreviewed' (UniProtKB/TrEMBL) to 'Reviewed' (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot).

A comprehensive archive of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry versions is available in the UniProtKB Sequence/Annotation Version Database (click on the 'History' button, and then on 'Previous versions'). Unlike UniProtKB, which contains only the latest Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entry and sequence versions, this archive provides access to all versions of UniProtKB entries. This allows the tracking of all changes that occurred in any entry.
