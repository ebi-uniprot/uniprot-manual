This subsection of the [Names and taxonomy](https://www.uniprot.org/help/names_and_taxonomy_section) section provides information on the name(s) of the organism that is the source of the protein sequence.

The organism designation consists of the Latin scientific name, usually composed of the genus and species names (the binomial system developed by Linnaeus), followed optionally by the English common name and a synonym.  
Examples: [Bacillus subtilis](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P08877#names_and_taxonomy), [Homo sapiens (Human)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P27169#names_and_taxonomy), [Cardamine pratensis (Cuckoo flower) (Alpine bitter cress)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q1G6S8#names_and_taxonomy)

The synonym can be a common name in English (or in Latin in the case of some historical legacy names).  
Example: [Radianthus magnifica (Magnificent sea anemone) (Heteractis magnifica)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O16846#names_and_taxonomy)

In the case of viruses, the designation does not follow the binomial system. The English common name is used as the scientific name, sometimes followed by an acronym. When possible, viruses are named according to the nomenclature of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( [ICTV](http://www.ictvonline.org/) ).  
Examples: [Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (isolate BRU/LAI group M subtype B) (HIV-1)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P03367#names_and_taxonomy), [Influenza A virus (strain A/Aichi/2/1968 H3N2)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotP03437#names_and_taxonomy)

The organism name can differ from that given by the international nucleotide sequence databases for the same taxon. This is mainly due to our efforts in providing the most descriptive common names and synonyms to our users.

Note that the proteome for a given organism, when available, can be accessed through the [proteomes](https://www.uniprot.org/proteome/) page of our website.
