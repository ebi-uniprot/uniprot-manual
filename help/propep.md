This subsection of the [PTM / Processing](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm_processing_section) section describes a propeptide, which is a part of a protein that is cleaved during maturation or activation. Once cleaved, a propeptide generally has no independent biological function.

Example: [P29958](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P29958#ptm_processing)

This subsection is only present when the existence of the propeptide has been demonstrated experimentally in the protein concerned or in a closely related homolog.  
Example: [Q8WXQ8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8WXQ8#ptm_processing)

Each propeptide has a [stable identifier](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_annotation#annotation_id).

We do not annotate the 2 to 4 basic amino acid residues regions produced by basic-specific proconvertase cleavage as a 'Propeptide', since these short oligopeptides are degraded and are generally not considered as bona fide propeptides.

Example: [P19802](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P19802#ptm_processing) ; Related keyword: [Cleavage on pair of basic residues](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/165)
