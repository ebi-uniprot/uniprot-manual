This subsection of the [PTM / Processing](http://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm%5Fprocessing%5Fsection) section describes a propeptide, which is a part of a protein that is cleaved during maturation or activation. Once cleaved, a propeptide generally has no independent biological function.

Examples: [P29958](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P29958#ptm%5Fprocessing), [P21588](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P21588#ptm%5Fprocessing)

This subsection is only present when the existence of the propeptide has been demonstrated experimentally in the protein concerned or in a closely related homolog.  
Example: [Q8WXQ8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8WXQ8#ptm%5Fprocessing)

Each propeptide has a [stable identifier](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fannotation#annotation%5Fid) .

We do not annotate the 2 to 4 basic amino acid residues regions produced by basic-specific proconvertase cleavage as a 'Propeptide', since these short oligopeptides are degraded and are generally not considered as bona fide propeptides.
