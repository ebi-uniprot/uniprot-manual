**What is PIRSR and PIRNR?**

PIRSR (site rule) and PIRNR (name rule) are annotation rules based on PIRSF (protein families with full-length sequence similarity). These rules are manually curated to accurately and automatically annotate protein sequences. PIRSRs annotate sequence features for sites, such as catalytic site, and binding site. PIRNRs annotations may include protein name, keywords, and general annotation, such as function, subcellular location, and pathway.

For more information please go to the [PIRSF website](https://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/dbinfo/pirsf.shtml).
