This subsection of the [Names and taxonomy](https://www.uniprot.org/help/names_and_taxonomy_section) section contains the taxonomic hierarchical classification lineage of the source organism. It lists the nodes as they appear top-down in the taxonomic tree, with the more general grouping listed first.

The taxonomy classification is maintained at the [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/) and is used by the nucleotide sequence databases (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ).

The NCBI taxonomy classification is built mainly from sequence data information, but it also relies on published authorities whenever possible. It strives to reflect current phylogenetic knowledge accurately, despite the inherent ambiguity of evolutionary classification. The NCBI taxonomy is intended to be informative and to address the specific needs of database users (e.g. trying to track down the phylogenetic history of a group of organisms or to elucidate the evolution of a molecule); no claim is made that it is the best or the most exact.
