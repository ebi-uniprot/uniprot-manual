This page is designed to give a quick summary of the \[Proteomes\]([https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes)) and \[UniProtKB\]([https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb)) changes happening in the coming months and how this might affect user work-flows.  
A comprehensive list of affected protein entries and proteomes is available \[here\](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/contrib/UniProt/proteomes/).

# Our current release
## Release 2025\_04 
15th October 2025

Changes that we are making in this release:

- Removal of taxonomically unclassified proteins\* from UniProtKB.  
- Addition of proteins from new reference proteomes to UniProtKB.

Changes in numbers:

- Removal of 85 million protein entries from UniProtKB that are mainly from taxonomically unclassified species.  
- Addition of 31 million protein entries to UniProtKB, most of which are from new reference proteomes.  
- Resulting in a total decrease in the protein entries found in UniProtKB from 253 million to 199 million.

How this might affect you:

- Taxonomically unclassified proteins that were previously found in UniProtKB can still be accessed in \[UniParc\](https://www.uniprot.org/uniparc). In UniParc users can find information such as the protein sequence, gene and protein names, and InterPro signatures etc. UniParc can be searched by protein accession number or proteome identifier, either through the website or programmatically via our \[APIs\](https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic\_access), to locate your protein(s) of interest.  
- Addition of novel protein entries to UniProtKB from new reference proteomes.  
- In the weeks leading up to December 2026, users have the opportunity to provide \[feedback\](https://www.uniprot.org/contact) on the changes and express possible concerns about specific entries that are due to be removed from UniProtKB in 2026\_02.

# Future releases

## Release 2026\_01
Currently expected early 2026

Changes that we are making in this release:

- No major changes \- this is to provide time for users to adapt their work to correspond to future changes coming in release 2026\_02.

Changes in numbers:

- Very few changes will be made to UniProtKB and Proteomes outside of the scope of our usual release cycle.

How this might affect you:

- There will only be minimal changes in UniProtKB and Proteomes that will be unlikely to affect users.

## Release 2026\_02
Currently expected in the late first or second quarter of 2026

Changes that we are making in this release:

- Removal of all remaining non-reference proteome protein entries (except reviewed (Swiss-Prot) or biologically highly relevant protein entries) from UniProtKB.

Changes in numbers:

- Removal of approximately 60 million protein entries from UniProtKB, which will result in an estimated total of 139 million entries remaining.

How this might affect you:

- Protein entries that do not belong to a Reference Proteome or that are not considered to be of high biological relevance can still be found in UniParc, where users can find some information such as the protein sequence, gene and protein names, InterPro signatures, etc.

\* Taxonomically unclassified entries refer to UniProtKB proteins where the associated species is unspecific, i.e., taxa that do not have a binomial species name (consisting of the genus name and species epithet). For example, both the taxa \[Escherichia sp.\](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/1884818) (and \[its proteomes\](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes?query=%28organism\_id%3A1884818%29)) and \[Athelia sp. TMB\](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/2748771) (and \[its proteome\](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes?query=%28organism\_id%3A2748771%29)) are taxonomically unclassified, whereas the species \[Arabis nemorensis\](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/586526) is classified.
