If the data sets you need are available on our [ftp site](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/), we recommend that you download them from there. Other data sets can be downloaded by querying this website (read [how to retrieve entries via queries programmatically](https://www.uniprot.org/help/api_queries)), but please use a [tool](https://www.uniprot.org/help/api_downloading) that makes use of the HTTP protocol's `If-Modified-Since` header to avoid more than one download per release.
