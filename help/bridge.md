#### Short biography

Dr. Alan Bridge joined the Swiss-Prot group at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Geneva in 2004 where he worked as a biocurator and in the Quality Assurance Department. In 2008 he became jointly responsible for the curated content of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and coordination of these activities with EMBL-EBI and PIR colleagues, and in 2009, was made head of the Department of Automation and Enhancements. Dr. Bridge was appointed as the Director of the Swiss-Prot group in 2018 and is responsible for all aspects of the group's work, including resource development, training and outreach, and coordination with its international partners. The Swiss-Prot group develops and maintains a number of internationally renowned resources including UniProt, a resource of protein sequences and functional annotation (with partners EMBL-EBI and PIR), the [PROSITE](https://prosite.expasy.org/) and [HAMAP](https://hamap.expasy.org/) resources for protein classification and annotation, the [ENZYME](https://enzyme.expasy.org/) resource for enzyme nomenclature, the [Rhea](https://www.rhea-db.org/) resource of biochemical reactions, and the [ViralZone](https://viralzone.expasy.org/) resource of viral biology.

#### Group

The [Swiss-Prot group](https://www.sib.swiss/alan-bridge-group) develops, annotates and maintains the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein sequence database, and also other databases including PROSITE, a database of protein families and domains, and ENZYME, a database of enzyme nomenclature. The group also co-heads the development and maintenance of the [Expasy](https://www.expasy.org/) website, a life sciences portal which serves as an entry point to several databases and to various online bioinformatics tools.
