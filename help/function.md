This subsection of the [Function](https://www.uniprot.org/help/function_section) describes the function(s) of a protein.

When a protein is a precursor of different chains/peptides having different functions, we specify the role of each peptide in separate paragraphs.  
Examples: [Q8MMJ7](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8MMJ7#function), [Q9UBU3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9UBU3#function)

The same holds true for isoform-specific functions.  
Example: [P16157](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P16157#function)

Multifunctional enzymes should have only one 'Function' section for the different activities.  
Example: [P0A9Q8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0A9Q8#function)

When a protein displays some very different or contradictory functions depending on the context, they are described in different sentences. This case is rare.  
Example: [Q8WVD3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8WVD3#function)

Note that physiological ligands of receptors are cited in this section, and not in the 'Interaction' section.  
Example: [P29317](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P29317#function)
