### Journals (citations/publications)

The [Controlled vocabulary of journals](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/jourlist) lists the journal abbreviations used in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. The abbreviations are those proposed by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and they generally correspond to those used by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in PubMed.

### Plasmids

The [Controlled vocabulary of plasmids](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/plasmid) lists the currently valid values for the plasmids cited in the [Encoded on](https://www.uniprot.org/help/encoded%5Fon) subsection of the 'Names and origin' section and in the [Reference](https://www.uniprot.org/help/references) section of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.

### Post-translational modifications

The [Controlled vocabulary of posttranslational modifications (PTM)](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist) lists the posttranslational modifications (PTM) used in the sequence annotation section of the UniProt knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL). Additional information such as amino acid target, subcellular location, monoisotopic mass difference, average mass difference, taxonomic range, corresponding keyword etc. are listed when available.

### Taxonomy

#### Species

The [Controlled vocabulary of species](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/speclist) contains two sublists: the *Real organism codes*, which are used in both UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL and which correspond to a specific and specified organism; the *Virtual organism codes* that regroup organisms at a certain taxonomic level. They generally correspond to a 'pool' of organisms and are used only in UniProtKB/TrEMBL.

### Extracellular domains

The document: [Nomenclature of extracellular domains](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/extradom) lists the nomenclature proposal for domains (or modules) found mainly in extracellular proteins of higher eukaryotes. These domains are described in the 'Sequence annotation' section of entries.
