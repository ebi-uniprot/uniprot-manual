# Genomic coordinates tab
This tab on some UniProtKB entries displays genomic coordinates information related to the corresponding UniProtKB entry.

## Origin of the data
This data has been imported from...

UniProtKB entries with this data are...

The entries that won't have data for this tab are...

This data is available from the genomic coordinates endpoint of the Proteins REST API which is one of the [programmatic interfaces offered by UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic_access).

## Sections of the tab
This tab presents the data described above grouped by gene and showing some basic information for each gene like the chromosome and strand.

For each gene, the isoforms covering it are listed with their corresponding genomic location and number of exons, and a table shows for each coordinates corresponding to the different exons which isoforms include it and at which protein coordinate.
