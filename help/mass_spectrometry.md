This subsection of the 'Sequence' section reports information derived from mass spectrometry experiments done on the entire protein or on biologically active derived peptide(s).

The following information items are provided:

- optionally: the name of an isoform or product of proteolytic cleavage;
- determined molecular weight (mass) (in Daltons) and, if known, the accuracy or estimated mass error of the MW measurement;
- ionization method used;
- link to the corresponding publication.

Additional information, if available, is provided to complement the above information items.  
Example: [O44185](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O44185#sequences)

We do not provide mass spectrometry information for digested peptides, but link to tools which allow to predict the cleavage products, e.g. [PeptideMass](https://web.expasy.org/peptide_mass/) or [PeptideCutter](https://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/). These links are available from the 'Sequence' section (e.g. [O44185](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O44185#sequences)), via the tools menu whose default selection is "Blast".
