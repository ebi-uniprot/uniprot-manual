This subsection of the [PTM / Processing](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm_processing_section) section indicates that the initiator methionine is cleaved from the mature protein.

Example: [Q9H425](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9H425#ptm_processing)

Cleavage of the initiator methionine is one of the most common protein modifications and occurs co-translationally.

This subsection is only present when cleavage has been experimentally proven or when it can be propagated 'By similarity' with closely related homologs.  
Example: [P31946](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P31946#ptm_processing)

The comment 'The displayed sequence is further processed into a mature form' is added in the corresponding ['Sequence'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences_section) section.  
Example: [P31946](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q7XAD0#sequences)
