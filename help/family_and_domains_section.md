This section provides information on sequence similarities with other proteins and the domain(s) present in a protein.

The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:

**Subsection**

**Content**

[Domain](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/domain)

Denotes the position and type of each modular protein domain

[Repeat](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/repeat)

Denotes the positions of repeated sequence motifs or repeated domains

[Compositional bias](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/compbias)

Region of compositional bias in the protein

[Region](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/region)

Region of interest in the sequence

[Coiled coil](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/coiled)

Denotes the positions of regions of coiled coil within the protein

[Motif](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/motif)

Short (up to 20 amino acids) sequence motif of biological interest

[Domain (non-positional)](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/domain_cc)

Description of the domain(s) present in a protein

[Sequence similarities](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence_similarities)

Description of the sequence similaritie(s) with other proteins

[Keywords 'Domain'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-9994)

Selection of controlled vocabulary which summarises the content of an entry
