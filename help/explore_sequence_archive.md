UniParc is a comprehensive and non-redundant database that contains most of the publicly available protein sequences in the world. UniParc stores each unique sequence only once, giving it a stable and unique identifier (UPI).

You can access UniParc from the UniProt homepage or by selecting it from the dropdown in front of the search bar and entering your search term.

For example, let’s enter a query and click the search button.

The results table presents information such as entry accession, organisms, links to related UniProtKB entries, dates when the source database entry was associated with this sequence for the first time (First seen), when it was last confirmed to be associated with this sequence (Last seen), and sequence length.

You can customize your results table by clicking "Customize data" to add or remove information.

You can select an entry to run a direct BLAST sequence similarity search or select multiple entries to run an alignment.

You can download entries in various formats and you can also save them for later by adding them to your basket. The selections in your basket remain until you delete them or clear your cookies.
