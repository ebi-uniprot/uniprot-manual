title: Sequence annotation (Features)
type: help
categories: manual,Technical
---

Sequence annotations describe regions or sites of interest in the protein sequence, such as post-translational modifications, binding sites, enzyme active sites, local secondary structure or other characteristics reported in the cited references, or predicted. Sequence conflicts between references are also described in this manner.

Sequence annotations (position-specific annotations) used to be found in the 'Sequence annotation (Features)' section in a previous version of the UniProtKB entry view. The current entry view displays annotation by subject (Function, PTM & processing, etc), and the various position-specific annotations are distributed to the relevant sections. The [text](https://www.uniprot.org/release-notes/2019-12-18-release#text_ft) and XML formats still group all position-specific annotation together in a "feature table" (FT). 

The same holds true for [general annotations (comments)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/general_annotation).

Each sequence annotation consists of a "feature key", "from" and "to" positions as well as a short description.

The exact boundaries of the described sequence feature, as well as its length, are provided. When a feature is known to extend beyond the position that is given in this section, the endpoint specification will be preceded by '<' (less than) for features which continue to the N-terminal direction or by '>' (greater than) for features which continue to the C-terminal direction.

Example: [P62756](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P62756#ptm_processing)

Unknown endpoints are denoted by a question mark '?'.

Example: [P78586](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P78586#ptm_processing)

Uncertain endpoints are denoted by a question mark '?' before the position, e.g. '?42'.

Example: [Q3ZC31](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q3ZC31#ptm_processing)

# Querying Features

Individual features can be queried using the query fields described in the tables above. Querying is of the form:

```bash
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query=FIELD:VALUE"
```

For example, to find all Human entries with variants, we could run the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query=ft_variant:*%20AND%20organism_id:9606"
```

## Querying for Features with experimental evidence

Queries for any feature type can be restricted to annotations for which experimental evidence is available. To do this, every feature type `ft_XXXX` has a corresponding field that allows to query for annotations with experimental evidence, `ft_XXXX_exp`.

For example, to find human entries with ATP binding sites annotated on the basis of experimental evidence, we can execute the following command:

```bash
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query=ft_binding_exp:ATP%20AND%20organism_id:9606"
```

# Feature identifiers

Some features are associated with a unique and stable identifier that allows to construct links between these position-specific annotations and specialized protein-related databases.

The format of the identifiers is a 3-letter prefix, specific for an annotation type, separated by an underscore from a 6 to 10-digit number.

Feature identifiers currently exist for the following annotation topics: Propeptide, Chain, Peptide, Glycosylation, Alternative sequence and Natural variant.
