Since July 2021, we are providing a new API to access UniProt's data and tools. This replaces the services previously provided and you might have to update any workflow or scripts written before that date.

Supported query fields for searching specific data in UniProtKB (see also [query syntax](https://www.uniprot.org/help/text-search)) are shown in the table below.

[General annotation (comment)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/general_annotation) and [Sequence annotation (feature)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_annotation) topics and their query fields are documented in separate pages.

**Default sorting order:**

Note that the default sorting order is by score. Sorting is not available for the stream endpoints returning whole datasets. See the [API queries article](https://www.uniprot.org/help/api_queries) for the different use cases around the search and stream endpoints.
