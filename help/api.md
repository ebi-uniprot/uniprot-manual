UniProt has a number of freely available APIs that allow users to access data in their favourite programming languages.
Please see our [Programmatic access](https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic_access) page for further details of our API services and data endpoints.

All resources (individual entries as well as sets of entries retrieved by queries) are accessible through RESTful URLs that can be bookmarked, linked and used in programs.
Please see our [online training resources](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/services/uniprot), many of which include programmatic examples of how to access UniProt data.
