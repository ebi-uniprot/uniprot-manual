You can use the search bar in the UniProt banner at the top of all pages to search the various data sets provided by the UniProt Consortium. There is a drop-down list that allows to select the data set.

To search one of the UniProt resources proceed as follows:

1.  select the appropriate data set (the default selection is UniProtKB),
2.  type in your query and
3.  hit the search button.

Note that the background color around the search field changes depending on the data set, in order to keep you aware of the selected data set.

# Query syntax

Here is a brief overview of the supported query syntax (see also [query fields for UniProtKB](https://www.uniprot.org/help/query-fields) ):

To use characters that have a special meaning in the query syntax literally in your query, you must escape them with a backslash, e.g. use ['gene:L\\(1\\)2CB'](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=gene:L%5C(1%5C)2CB) to search for the gene name 'L(1)2CB'. The current list of special characters is:

`+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \\`

# Query builder

You can also access [advanced search options](https://www.uniprot.org/help/advanced%5Fsearch) by clicking on *'Advanced'*, e.g. to restrict terms to specific fields in advance or to combine multiple terms using boolean logic. Depending on the chosen data set and field, you can enter some text or choose values from various levels of drop-down lists. Then click the search button ("looking glass" icon) to run the query.

The advanced search interface allows to browse the different search fields and options within the dropdown menus. There is a search box right at the top when you open the blue dropdown menu that allows you to type a concept name (e.g. 'structure') and receive some autocompleted suggestions from which you can then select the most suitable one:
