UniProtKB is a protein sequence database and our staff consists of biologists and biochemists that are not trained to give medical advice.

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains a limited amount of **information concerning genetic diseases** (in the [Pathology and Biotech](http://www.uniprot.org/help/pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech%5Fsection) section, [Involvement in disease](http://www.uniprot.org/help/involvement%5Fin%5Fdisease) subsection), as well as **sequence information on some disease-linked variations** (see [Sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences%5Fsection) section, or [Natural variant](http://www.uniprot.org/help/variant) ' under 'Pathology and Biotech').

see:

-   [How can I get all the proteins involved in a given disease?](http://www.uniprot.org/help/disease%5Fquery)

Much more information on diseases is available from the [OMIM database](http://www.omim.org/).

In case you are interested in a "rare" genetic disease you can look up the [Orphanet website](http://www.orpha.net/), which is cross-referenced from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry pages and also has links to disease-specific patient organizations.

In addition, the following sites may be of help as they offer a variety of links to information sources on medical topics:

-   [HON - The Health On the Net foundation server](http://www.hon.ch/)
-   [MedicineNet - Medical Reference Site](http://www.medicinenet.com/)
-   [MedSite Navigator - Medical and Biotech site](http://www.medsitenavigator.com/)
-   [Medline Plus: NLM list of resources for health questions](http://medlineplus.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/)
-   [The Medical Reference Resource Library](http://www.guidetohealthcareschools.com/library/medical-reference)
