_previously called "pathology and biotech"_

This section provides information on the disease(s), phenotype(s), and variants associated with a protein.

The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:

Please note that there is a difference in data sources in the variants section.
The information filed in the different subsections below are manually curated and maintained by UniProt.

The data in the "Variants" subsection with the variant visualisation include both manually curated and automatically imported data from external sources such as dbSNP and ClinVar.
For accessing and downloading variant data, please check out the [Proteins API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/doc/#!/variation/getVariation).
