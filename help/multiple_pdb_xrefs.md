title: Why are there multiple cross-references to PDB in a UniProtKB entry?

3D structures convey important experimental evidence on a protein: its secondary structure, how it is folded, which parts of the polypeptide chain are available for interactions with other proteins, and which residues are directly involved in the catalytic activity or in ligand-binding. 

There is often more than one experimentally determined structure available for a protein and this results in multiple cross-references to [PDB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe), one for each available structure or PDB entry. 

These structures may be different to each other for various reasons:
1) They are solved by different experimental methods and have different resolutions. This may lead to different regions of the sequence observable in different structures.
2) Some structures consist of the apoprotein while others are protein complexes bound to various ligands or other interacting partners (proteins or nucleic acids).
3) Some structures consist of the wild-type protein while others may contain mutations or other modifications in the sequence.
4) Some structures consist of the full-length protein while others may only cover a specific region or domain of the full protein, depending on the constructs used by the structural biologists.

Given these differences, these structures might provide different information and therefore all should be considered.
