Regions of a protein sequence that are specifically recognized by [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/about) antibodies used in protein expression and profiling experiments. 
Antibodies are generated against [Protein Epitope Signature Tag](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12796447/) (PrEST) fragments, whose sequences are selected based on the principles of lowest sequence similarity to other human proteins and for properties that optimize for efficient production in culture. Antibodies are validated by  Western blot and immunohistochemistry on cell lines and tissues from both normal and disease states.
For further information on antibody selection and validation see [HPA documentation](https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/antibody+validation#antigen_and_antibody_production)

HPA provides antibody data pages for each protein against which they have tested antibodies. This includes any antibody-specific information, an overview of validation tests, enhanced details of each validation step if available, and information on the antigenic region.

# Where can I find this data in UniProt?

Antibody binding sequence regions are shown under the ‘Antigenic sequences’ track of the protein entry Feature viewer in the ‘Antibody binding sequences’ sub-track. Selecting an antibody binding region opens a tooltip which displays data specific to this antigen region, including a link to the relevant HPA page.<br>
This data can only be found in human entries.<br>
