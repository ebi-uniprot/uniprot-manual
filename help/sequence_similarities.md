This subsection of the 'Family and domains' section provides information about the sequence similarity with other proteins.

This subsection only states sequence similarity, thus excluding proteins with a related name that may function in the same biological pathway, but do not share sequence similarities.

The 'Sequence similarities' subsection provides information on protein families the protein **belongs to**.

The lines are listed in alphanumerical order.

Examples: [Q9C9W3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9C9W3#family_and_domains), [Q03395](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q03395#family_and_domains), [Q15022](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q15022#family_and_domains), [P0A6X0](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0A6X0#family_and_domains), [O31792](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O31792#family_and_domains)

A protein may belong to two (or even more) different families. In this case, we indicate which part of the protein belongs to a given family.

Example: [P40939](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P40939#family_and_domains), [O75521](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O75521#family_and_domains)
