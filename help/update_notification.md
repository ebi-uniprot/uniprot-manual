Subscribing to [RSS feeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) allows you to receive the [latest news](http://www.uniprot.org/news/) ( [subscribe](http://www.uniprot.org/news/?format=rss) ) and [forthcoming changes](http://www.uniprot.org/help/changes) ( [subscribe](http://www.uniprot.org/help/?fil=section:changes&format=rss) ) for UniProt.

You can also keep track of updates to individual UniProtKB entries: Click on the 'History' button on the entry page, and then on the 'rss' link to subscribe to the feed. You will receive a message whenever there is a new version of the entry, with a link to a page showing where the entry was modified compared to the previous version.

If you use a [feed reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5Ffeed%5Faggregators), copy the URL of the feed, for example `https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P05067.rss?version=*` into your reader.
