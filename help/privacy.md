# 2. Which is the lawful basis for processing personal data?

Processing your personal data is necessary for our legitimate interests in providing services to you, to help improve our resources and for the purposes of day-to-day running of the UniProt resource and underlying infrastructure.

# 3. What personal data is collected from users of the service? How do we use this personal data?

The personal data collected from the services listed below is as follows:

## Website and API

Information that we collect about each request made to the website or API, this data is stored for 7 days:
* IP address
* Date and time of a visit to the service
* Operating system
* Browser
* Amount of data transmitted

This is in order to quickly respond to bugs that might appear and might be linked to the experience of some users based on their specific setup.

Following the 7 day period we only have access to this pseudonymized data for each request to the website or the API:
* IP address country (not each specific IP address)
* Date and time of a visit to the service
* Operating system (only for the website, not for the API)
* Browser (only for the website, not for the API)
* Amount of data transmitted

This is kept in order to report to our funders in an aggregated way. These are important metrics that need to be reported in order to continue receiving the adequate grants to guarantee the open and free access to our data to everyone around the world.
There is no way for us to tie 2 different requests to the same user or to identify that user.

## Help desk
* Name
* Email address

## Bibliography Submission (Community Curation) 
* ORCID ID
* Email address
* Affiliation (optional)

Note: We collect the submitter's name from the ORCID account unless the submitter selects to remain anonymous, in which case neither name nor ORCID ID are displayed with the submission.

The data controller will use your personal data for the following purposes:
* To provide the user access to the service
* To answer questions from users
* To better understand the needs of the users and guide future improvements of the service
* To create anonymous usage statistics
* To conduct and monitor data protection activities
* To conduct and monitor security activities

# 4. Who will have access to your personal data?

Personal data will only be disclosed to authorized staff at the institutions that form the UniProt Consortium.

# 5. Will your personal data be transferred to third countries (i.e. countries not part of EU/EAA) and/or international organisations?

There are no personal data transfers to international organisations outside of the UniProt Consortium.

UniProt uses [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Contentsquare/Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy/) and [Sentry](https://sentry.io/privacy/) as third-party analytics services to collect information about website performance and how users navigate through and use our website to help us design better interfaces. We do not use any of these services to track you individually or collect personal data.

# 6. How long do we keep your personal data?

Any personal data directly obtained from you will be retained as long as the service is live, even if you stop using the service. We will keep the personal data for the minimum amount of time possible to ensure legal compliance and to facilitate internal and external audits if they arise.

# 7. The joint Data Controllers provide these rights regarding your personal data

You have the right to:

1. Not be subject to decisions based solely on an automated processing of data (i.e. without human intervention) without you having your views taken into consideration.
2. Request at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense, information about the personal data processed about you. Under your request we will inform you in writing about, for example, the origin of the personal data or the preservation period.
3. Request information to understand data processing activities when the results of these activities are applied to you.
4. Object at any time to the processing of your personal data unless we can demonstrate that we have legitimate reasons to process your personal data.
5. Request free of charge and without excessive delay rectification or erasure of your personal data if we have not been processing it respecting the data protection policies of the respective controllers.

Requests and objections can be sent to our [helpdesk](https://www.uniprot.org/contact).

It must be clarified that rights 4 and 5 are only available whenever the processing of your personal data is not necessary to:

* Comply with a legal obligation.
* Perform a task carried out in the public interest.
* Exercise authority as a data controller.
* Archive for purposes in the public interest, or for historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes.
* Establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
