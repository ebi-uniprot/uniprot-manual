The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. The UniProt databases are the [UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb), the [UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref), and the [UniProt Archive (UniParc)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc). The UniProt consortium and host institutions EMBL-EBI, SIB and PIR are committed to the long-term preservation of the UniProt databases.

UniProt is a collaboration between the [European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/) and the [Protein Information Resource (PIR)](https://proteininformationresource.org/). Across the three institutes more than [100 people](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprot_staff) are involved through different tasks such as database curation, software development and support.

EMBL-EBI and SIB together used to produce Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL, while PIR produced the Protein Sequence Database (PIR-PSD). These two data sets coexisted with different protein sequence coverage and annotation priorities. TrEMBL (Translated EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library) was originally created because sequence data was being generated at a pace that exceeded Swiss-Prot's ability to keep up. Meanwhile, PIR maintained the PIR-PSD and related databases, including iProClass, a database of protein sequences and curated families. In 2002 the three institutes decided to pool their resources and expertise and formed the UniProt consortium.

The UniProt consortium is headed by [Alex Bateman](https://www.uniprot.org/help/bateman), [Alan Bridge](https://www.uniprot.org/help/bridge) and [Cathy Wu](http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/aboutpir/wubio.shtml), supported by [key staff](https://www.uniprot.org/help/key_staff), and receives valuable input from an independent [Scientific Advisory Board](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sab).

# Funding

Additional support for the EMBL-EBI's involvement in UniProt comes from [European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)](http://www.embl.org/) core funds, the [Alzheimer's Research UK (ARUK)](https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/) grant ARUK-NAS2017A-1, the [Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/) [BB/T010541/1] and [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/). UniProt activities at the SIB are additionally supported by the Swiss Federal Government through the [State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html). PIR's UniProt activities are also supported by the NIH grants R01GM080646, G08LM010720, and P20GM103446, and the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](http://www.nsf.gov/) grant DBI-1062520.
