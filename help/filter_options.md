A search result page is subdivided into a filter panel on the left, and the actual result table on the right, occupying the majority of the screen space.

You can use the filter panel to filter your search results in UniProtKB by **reviewed/unreviewed** status, or by organism, or you can restrict your search terms to certain query fields.

# Organism filters

Under the heading **"Popular organisms"**, your query results are broken down by organism. Filters allow you to see the matches from the 5 best represented organisms among a list of 12 organisms.

These organisms are [Human](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9606), [Mouse](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10090), [Rat](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10116), [Cow](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9913), [Zebrafish](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7955), [Drosophila](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7227), [C.elegans](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/6239), [Slime mold](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/44689), [A.thaliana](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/3702), [Rice](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/39947), [E.coli K12](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/83333), [B.subtilis](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/224308), [S.cerevisiae](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/559292).

For performance reasons it is currently not possible to provide a **complete** breakdown of query results by organism, since result sets can be huge. A "Group by > Taxonomy" link is available further down the filter panel and provides a similar functionality.

If you are interested in another organism, you can open the advanced search by clicking "Advanced" on the right of the top search bar, and specify its name in a **"Taxonomy [OC]"** search field, which supports auto-completion.

## Notes

- An active filter is graphically highlighted in the filter panel.

- All the filters described here can be un-selected by clicking on the cross to their right.

- Only filters which are valid for your search results will appear. For example, if the search term is not found in the gene name of any of your results, the gene name filter will not appear.

- Only filters which would further narrow down your search results will appear. For example, in a full text search with [polytrichum commune](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=polytrichum%20commune), the result only contains entries from the organism [Polytrichum commune (Haircap moss)](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/3213) and there will not be a filter to restrict the terms to the organism field.
