This section displays by default the canonical protein sequence and upon request all isoforms described in the entry. It also includes information pertinent to the sequence(s), including [length](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Flength) and [molecular weight](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences). The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:

**Subsection**

**Content**

[Sequence status](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence%5Fstatus)

Indicates if the protein sequence is complete or not

[Sequence processing](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence%5Fprocessing)

Indicates if the mature form of a protein is derived by processing of a precursor

[Sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequences)

Canonical protein sequence data and list of described protein isoforms

[Alternative products](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/alternative%5Fproducts)

Description of the different proteins generated from the same gene

[Computationally mapped potential isoform sequences](http://www.uniprot.org/help/gene%5Fcentric%5Fisoform%5Fmapping)

Automatic gene-centric isoform mapping for eukaryotic reference proteome sequences

[Sequence caution](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence%5Fcaution)

Warning about possible errors related to the protein sequence

[RNA editing](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/rna%5Fediting)

Description of amino acid change(s) due to RNA editing

[Mass spectrometry](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/mass%5Fspectrometry)

Information derived from mass spectrometry experiments

[Polymorphism](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/polymorphism)

Description of polymorphism(s)

[Natural variant](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/variant)

Description of a natural variant of the protein

[Alternative sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/var%5Fseq)

Amino acid change(s) producing alternate protein isoforms

[Sequence uncertainty](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/unsure)

Regions of uncertainty in the sequence

[Sequence conflict](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/conflict)

Description of sequence discrepancies of unknown origin

[Non-adjacent residues](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/non%5Fcons)

Indicates that two residues in a sequence are not consecutive

[Non-terminal residue](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/non%5Fter)

The sequence is incomplete. Indicate that a residue is not the terminal residue of the complete protein

[Non-standard residue](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/non%5Fstd)

Occurence of non-standard amino acids (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) in the protein sequence
