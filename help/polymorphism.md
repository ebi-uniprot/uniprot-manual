This subsection of the 'Sequence' section provides information on polymorphic variants. If the variant is associated with a disease state, the description of the latter can be found in the ['Involvement in disease'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/involvement_in_disease) subsection.

Comments on single variants are usually found in the '[Natural variant](https://www.uniprot.org/help/variant)' subsection. The subsection 'Polymorphism' is used only when the information cannot be accommodated in the '[Natural variant](https://www.uniprot.org/help/variant)' subsection.  
Example: [P15516](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P15516#sequences)

This subsection may contain OMIM accession numbers, if available.  
Example: [P59533](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P59533#sequences)

It can be used to describe global variations in the population, such as blood group systems or polymorphic repeats.  
Example: [Q92482](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q92482#sequences), [P10275](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P10275#sequences)  
Since repeat expansion may lead to disease onset, both subsections '[Polymorphism](https://www.uniprot.org/help/polymorphism)' and '[Involvement in disease](https://www.uniprot.org/help/involvement_in_disease)' may be present in an entry.  
Examples: [P54259](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P54259#sequences), [P42858](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P42858#sequences)

Alleles described in this subsection follow the official nomenclature.  
Example: [Q03519](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q03519#sequences)
