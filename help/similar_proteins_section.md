# UniRef clusters

This section provides links to proteins that are similar to the protein sequence(s) described in this entry at different levels of sequence identity thresholds (100%, 90% and 50%) based on their membership in UniProt Reference Clusters ([UniRef](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref)).

# Orthology and paralogy

Ths section provides orthology and paralogy information which has been retrieved from the Alliance of Genome Resources (AGR). Orthology describes genes from different species that have evolved from a common ancestral gene through a speciation event, meaning these genes typically perform similar functions across species. Paralogy, on the other hand, refers to genes within the same species that originated from duplication events, often resulting in genes with related but distinct functions.

## Data source

The orthology and paralogy data presented within UniProtKB entry pages is sourced from the Alliance of Genome Resources (AGR), a collaborative effort that integrates comprehensive genetic and genomic data from multiple model organisms and humans. AGR utilizes the DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT), which consolidates results from various ortholog and paralog prediction methods along with expert-curated information from resources like HGNC (human and mouse), Xenbase (frog), ZFIN (zebrafish), and SGD (yeast).
