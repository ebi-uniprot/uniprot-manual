This subsection of the ['Structure'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/structure%5Fsection) section is used to indicate the positions of experimentally determined hydrogen-bonded turns within the protein sequence. These elements correspond to the DSSP secondary structure code 'T'.

In UniProtKB the positions of hydrogen-bonded turns are neither predicted by computational means, nor propagated 'By similarity' to related species.
