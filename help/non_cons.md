title: Non-adjacent residues
categories: Sequence,manual
---

This subsection of the 'Sequence' section is used to indicate that two residues in a sequence are not consecutive and that there is an undetermined number of unsequenced residues between them.

Example: [P68251](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P68251#sequences)

The 'Non-adjacent residues' subsection is used for incomplete protein sequence entries and is accompanied by the 'Fragments' flag in the ['Sequence status'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence_status) subsection.
