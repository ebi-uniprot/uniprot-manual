categories: Sequence,manual

This subsection of the 'Sequence' section is used to indicate that two residues in a sequence are not consecutive and that there is an undetermined number of unsequenced residues between them.

Example: [P68251](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P68251#sequences)

The 'Non-adjacent residues' subsection is used for incomplete protein sequence entries and is accompanied by the 'Fragments' flag in the ['Sequence status'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_status) subsection.
