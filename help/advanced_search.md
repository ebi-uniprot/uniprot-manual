The advanced search interface allows to browse the different search fields and options within the dropdown menus. There is a search box right at the top when you open the blue dropdown menu that allows you to type a concept name (e.g. "structure") and receive some autocompleted suggestions from which you can then select the most suitable one:

The table below lists the different options available in the "Advanced search" menu for the UniProt Knowledgebase. Columns 2 to 4 correspond to the submenu levels that are provided for some sections, after clicking on the (sub-)section name in the advanced search interface.

The 2-letter codes in square brackets (e.g. "\[DE\]", "\[CC\]") correspond to the line codes used in the flat text files.
