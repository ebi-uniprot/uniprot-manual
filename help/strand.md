This subsection of the ['Structure'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/structure%5Fsection) section is used to indicate the positions of experimentally determined beta strands within the protein sequence.

We annotate the positions of hydrogen-bonded beta strands (or extended strands) and residues in isolated beta bridges, corresponding to the DSSP secondary structure codes 'E' and 'B', respectively.

In UniProtKB, the positions of beta strands are neither predicted by computational means, nor propagated 'By similarity' to related species.
