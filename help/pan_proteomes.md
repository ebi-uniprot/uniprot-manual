A pan proteome is the full set of proteins thought to be expressed by a group of highly related organisms (e.g. multiple strains of the same bacterial species).

Pan proteomes provide a representative set of all the sequences within a taxonomic group and capture unique sequences not found in the group's [reference proteome](https://www.uniprot.org/help/reference_proteome). UniProtKB pan proteomes encompass all non-redundant proteomes and are aimed at users interested in phylogenetic comparisons and the study of genome evolution and gene diversity.

When a proteome has proteins that are part of a larger pan proteome, you will see it indicated on the proteome page in the 'Pan proteome' row. You will also see a link to download the full fasta sequence set, e.g. [Bacillus subtilis 168](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000001570).

Pan proteome sets can be downloaded from the UniProt FTP site through the [Pan proteomes](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/pan_proteomes/) subdirectory.
