RuleBase rules are annotation rules based on protein family members, from InterPro. These rules are manually curated to accurately and automatically annotate protein sequences. RuleBase rules may include protein annotation such as recommended name, alternative name, short name, function, catalytic activity, cofactor, similarity comment, subcellular location, pathway, EC number, domains, subunit comment, GO terms and keywords. It can also contain annotation when the Sequence Analysis Method (SAM) feature predicts transmembrane regions in the protein.
