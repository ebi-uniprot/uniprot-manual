<strong id="martin">Maria J. Martin, Ph.D.</strong>  
<u>Team Leader, Protein Function Development (EMBL-EBI)</u>  
Dr. Martin is the Protein Function Development Team Leader at the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge, UK. She is a world expert in the management of database resources with twenty years of experience in developing protein sequence resources at EMBL-EBI. Since joining EMBL-EBI in 1996, she has been involved in the strategic planning, data analysis and development of many database resources at this institute with special focus on protein data and leading the bioinformatics aspects of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt), the world leading database of classified and functionally annotated protein sequences. In this role, she has extensive experience in developing database software and tools for UniProt and GO biocurators and researchers. Additionally, she leads the GO Annotation development team and the Enzyme portal resource. Her interests include the study of novel methods for protein annotation and representation, the provision of quality annotation Reference Proteomes for the scientific community, and data analysis and visualization of protein data in the context of other -omics data i.e. proteomics and variation. She is key staff of the UniProt Consortium and an active member of the GO and QfO Consortia. Dr. Martin has served on numerous scientific advisory committees, such as the SysKid consortium, a large-scale integrating European research project in kidney disease. She is the EMBL-EBI Scientific Lead for Open targets, a public-private partnership that uses human genetics and multi-omics data for systematic drug-target identification and prioritization. She has well-established working relationships with many groups in UK and Consortium members, and a broad network of contacts that include the NCBI in the USA, various sequencing centers and users specializing in a variety of biological domains.

<strong id="mcgarvey">Peter B. McGarvey, Ph.D.</strong>  
<u>Scientific Coordinator (PIR)</u>  
Dr. McGarvey is Director of the Innovation Center for Biomedical Informatics (ICBI) and Associate Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology, Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC). He is coordinator and a bioinformatics scientist for UniProt at PIR and is involved in outreach and dissemination activities. He has academic and commercial experience in molecular biology, biotechnology, bioinformatics and software development, and his current research involves proteomic and genomic data analysis, molecular medicine, health informatics and applications of AI/ML to all of them.

<strong id="natale">Darren Natale, Ph.D.</strong>  
<u>Team Lead, Protein Science (PIR)</u>  
Dr. Natale joined PIR in 2002. He ensures the validity of the relationships between proteins classified by sequence similarity. He is responsible for providing these protein classes with names and detailed functional, structural and evolutionary descriptions. The focus of Dr. Natale's input in the UniProt project is, in part, the creation and curation of annotation rules governing the enhancement of information about uncharacterized proteins based on what is known about closely-related characterized proteins. He is a curator for both the UniProtKB and for Protein Ontology, and for each, he uses large-scale data mining coupled with manual oversight to make useful scientific inferences. He possesses over 25 years' experience with protein comparison and classification, the lynchpin of annotation transfer.
