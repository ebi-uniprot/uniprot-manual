The proteome identifier (UPID) is the unique identifier assigned to the set of proteins that constitute the [proteome](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteomes_manual). It consists of the characters 'UP' followed by 9 digits, is stable across releases and can therefore be used to cite a UniProt proteome.

UniProtKB entries can be linked to one or more UPIDs. UPIDs generally correspond to one genome assembly, but in certain cases correspond to more than one assembly (e.g. when nuclear and mitochondrial [components](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_component) are sequenced and assembled independently).
