A [proteome](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome) is the set of proteins thought to be expressed by an organism.

## Protein count
Number of protein sequence entries associated with a proteome.

## Number of entries
Number of UniProtKB entries for regular proteomes, or UniParc entries for [redundant proteomes](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_redundancy). 

## Gene count
This is the total number of unique genes found in the proteome set. For *eukaryotic reference proteomes*, we have established an [automatic gene-centric mapping between entries that are likely to belong to the same gene](https://www.uniprot.org/help/gene_centric_isoform_mapping). This mapping is based on gene identifiers from Ensembl, EnsemblGenomes and model organism databases and, in cases where none of these are available, on gene names assigned by the original sequencing projects. Among the UniProtKB entries thus identified to code for the same gene, a single representative protein entry, preferable from Swiss-Prot, is chosen. The link provided under "Gene count" leads to a [downloadable set of the reference proteome, containing one entry per gene](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/README).

## Genome Assembly
The genome assembly is simply the genome sequence produced after chromosomes have been fragmented, those fragments have been sequenced, and the resulting sequences have been put back together.
