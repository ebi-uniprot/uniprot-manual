A proteome is the set of proteins thought to be expressed by an organism.

## Protein count
Number of protein sequences associated with a proteome.

## Number of entries
Number of UniProtKB entries for regular proteomes or UniParc entries for redundant proteomes. Generally, the protein count can be equal to the number of entries. However, redundant protein sequences are merged into a single UniProtKB entry, which explains the difference in numbers. There are more information about the redundant proteomes in [Reducing proteome redundancy](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_redundancy).

## Gene count
This is the total number of unique genes found in the proteome set, algorithmically computed. For each gene, a single representative protein sequence is chosen from the proteome. Where possible, reviewed (Swiss-Prot) protein sequences are chosen as the representatives.

## Genome Assembly
The genome assembly is simply the genome sequence produced after chromosomes have been fragmented, those fragments have been sequenced, and the resulting sequences have been put back together.
