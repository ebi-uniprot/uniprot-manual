UniProtKB Keywords constitute a [controlled vocabulary](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords) with a hierarchical structure. Keywords summarise the content of a UniProtKB entry and facilitate the search for proteins of interest.

Keywords are classified in 10 categories:

-   Biological process
-   Cellular component
-   Coding sequence diversity
-   Developmental stage
-   Disease
-   Domain
-   Ligand
-   Molecular function
-   Post-translational modification
-   Technical term

An entry often contains several keywords. Inside a category, the keywords are stored in alphabetical order.  
Example: [P80643](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P80643#function)

Keywords can be used to retrieve subsets of protein entries or to generate indexes of entries based on functional, structural, or other categories.

# Keywords in UniProtKB/TrEMBL

UniProtKB/TrEMBL makes use of the same list of keywords as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot but, because most keywords in an entry are added in the manual annotation process, UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries generally contain fewer keywords than UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. The main sources of UniProtKB/TrEMBL keywords are:

-   The underlying nucleotide entry. The nucleotide databases (e.g.Â EMBL) contain keywords that are transferred to the corresponding UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry provided they are also present in the UniProtKB keyword list.
-   The program which creates UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries. This adds keywords based on information in the underlying nucleotide entry. For example, if a nucleotide entry contains the word "kinase" in the description field, the program will add the keyword "Kinase" to the corresponding UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry.
