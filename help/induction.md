This subsection of the 'Expression' section reports the experimentally proven effects of inducers and repressors (usually chemical compounds or environmental factors) on the level of protein (or mRNA) expression (up-regulation, down-regulation, constitutive expression).

Example: [Q7XTE8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q7XTE8#expression), [P29305](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P29305#expression)

Transcriptional regulation by transcription factors or repressors is only rarely described in UniProtKB. In some specific cases, however, we indicate such information without going into details.

Example: [Q59385](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q59385#expression)

This subsection does not describe the regulation of activity, which can be found in the subsection ' [Activity regulation](https://www.uniprot.org/help/activity_regulation) ' for enzymes, transporters and microbial transcription factors, and in other subsections, such as ' [Function](https://www.uniprot.org/help/function) '.
