**How is orthology established in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot?**

Information is combined from a variety of complementary sources to establish orthology relationships. Potential orthologs are initially identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST. Orthology relationships are then verified manually using a combination of resources including scientific literature, sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases such as Ensembl Compara, and other specialised databases such as species-specific collections.
