Searches in the Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), as well as in all other namespaces in the UniProt website, display results either in a card format, or in a tabular format.
In the tabular format you can configure which columns are shown in the result table, and have your selection reflected in the **download** of your data in form of a tab-separated file. You can also use the resulting URL [programmatically](https://www.uniprot.org/help/api).

When you click on the "Customize columns" button, accompanied by the pencil icon, which is located right above the results table, you will obtain a panel that lists all available columns, grouped in the same way as the corresponding data is grouped in the entry view. [Cross-referenced databases](https://www.uniprot.org/database?query=*) are listed separately, under "External links".

You can browse through the options, or use the search box to find a column name.

The columns currently shown in the table of results have a selected checkbox, and their parent categories show how many of those are selected in each group.

These checkboxes can be toggled on and off. Your selection is kept in the local memory of your browser and will be saved when you come back to the website in the future. This will also be reset if you clear the website's data, and will not be shared with another browser on your computer, or with another computer that you might also be using.

At any time, you can reset the selection by clicking the "Reset to default" at the bottom of each page.

Your column selection can be used to produce a **tab-separated output** containing the same set of columns, e.g. for use in a spreadsheet program such as Excel©: Once you are happy with your table layout, click on "Download" and select one of TSV or Excel formats.

Once you have customized your view, you can click on the "Share" > "Copy link to your results" link, which can be bookmarked or shared with colleagues. When this copied link is opened in another browser, it will show the exact same view that you were presented with, with the same columns in the same order.
