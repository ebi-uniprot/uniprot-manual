This subsection of the [Cross-references](https://www.uniprot.org/help/cross%5Freferences%5Fsection) section provides links to various web resources that are relevant for a specific protein.

Example: [Q9HC16](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9HC16#cross-references)

It complements the 'Cross-references' section by providing links to specific web pages or to databases whose scope is too specialized to legitimate the creation of specific cross-references.

Please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://www.uniprot.org/contact) to propose additional 'web resources'. Links to databases are only added as a comment, if the database is specific to annotations concerning the protein (e.g. structure, mutants, gene family). We do not link to pages that exclusively provide commercial information and only databases that are up-to date are taken into account.
