If you are accessing UniProt programmatically, using our [REST API](https://www.uniprot.org/help/api), and are just interested in the number of entries returned by your query, but not in downloading or listing all the hits, you can check the `X-Total-Results` header like in the PERL code example [Download all UniProt sequences for a given organism in FASTA format](https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic%5Faccess#downloading).

This returns the entry count, allowing you to count the hits without actually retrieving them.
