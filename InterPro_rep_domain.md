Representative domains are protein signatures selected to best represent domain annotations from multiple InterPro member databases and thus provide a non-redundant view of a protein’s features.
Domains are filtered by signature type to only include domains, repeats or homologous superfamilies which achieve maximal coverage of the protein sequence. Overlapping signatures are grouped, and within each group, only the top 20 domains are kept based on the extent of protein sequence coverage. The combination of  domains that have the lowest percentage overlap and highest unique residue coverage are selected by InterPro as the representative set of domains.
Representative domain sets are subject to change as member databases are updated.

For further information on how InterPro representative domains are selected and a full list of member databases, please see the [InterPro documentation](https://interpro-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/represent_dom.html) pages.

## Where can I find InterPro Representative Domains?

InterPro representative domains can be visualized in the ‘Domains’ track of the feature viewer, sub-track ‘InterPro Representative Domain’.\
Example: [O75445](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O75445/feature-viewer?loadFeatures=true)

Links to InterPro Representative Domain accession can be found in the ‘Family and Domains’ section of a protein entry.\
